――― 関 連 出 版 物 ――― PRAYERS AND GOSANKA （ Poems To Be Chanted ） FOREWORD Meishu-sama composed a large number of waka-(thirty-one syllable) poems on various subjects. From these, and also from Nidai-sama's poems, the following verses have been selected and compiled to be chanted at church services and on special occasions. The vibration of the Japanese words is very high and beautiful. While they could not be translated into English literally, we believe the true meaning of each poem has been preserved. lt is our hope that this work, which was transposed into the waka rhythm after translation, will fully convey Meishu-sama's teachings and feelings to our English-speaking members. If you will read at least one page each day, you will find you are benefiting greatly by doing so. CONTENTS Prayers For Church Service ............... Amatsu Norito .....................

How can this planet And all of the universe, Which God caused to be, To exist, remain confined Within darkness forever? lf all the people On this earth open their minds And become aware Of God and His Plan, darkness In the world will disappear.

For thousands of years － For eons － God has waited For the time to come. Now the right time has arrived; His Plan is being fulfilled. The great Plan of God For paradise on our earth Must begin somewhere, Must have a small prototype In the material world.

God works through mankind, Using each human being As His instrument To fulfill His Divine Plan For saving all of this world. Man's physical self Comes from his parents' union. His soul, however, Is bestowed on him by God, A part of His own Being.

Every soul is part, An individual part, Of God's Total Self. Let each one cleanse his own soul, Return it to its pure state. One who is aware That man is really priceless Is himself true man. Knowing man's divine nature, He becomes still more aware.

This Light is the one Humanity's awaited, The Power to save the world.

However lofty, Profound, its teachings may seem, Without miracles A religion won't inspire People to accept that faith. When a religion Clarifies life's mysteries － Which theorizing, Logic, can't explain － it is A real religion of Truth.

Through God's great Power, Let us break through the hard crust Of the false beliefs Covering man's vision through Trust in material things.

The coming New Age Will bring a crystal-clear world, In which everything, Even the smallest wrong deed Or cloud, is fully revealed.

The truth is the way, Virtue is the deed, the act, Beauty is the heart. I'm trying to help others To understand these precepts. Truth gives birth to good, Creates a virtuous heart. And goodness gives birth To beautiful expression. Let all believers know this.

A person whose thoughts, Words and deeds are always pure, Always beautiful, Can surely be considered One who lives in paradise.

The essence of faith, Of living it, is described Best with makoto. No other words are needed, No lesser word would suffice. Something is missing ln our material world. It is love, real love － God's Love expressed through mankind － That is lacking in our world.

Nothing has its strength, The power to penetrate Even an iron-hard rock. Makoto, true love, Is a most priceless treasure Cherished in the hearts Of sincere, honest persons In whom there is no falsehood. The basic reason The world's problems are baffling Solution so much Is the absence of real love Within the hearts of leaders.

The love of people Without faith in God is weak, Shallow, has no truth. Only the love of people Who have faith is a true love. Though we may speak well, Speak thousands of words smoothly, If they do not come From hearts that are full of love, They are empty, powerless.

――― 関 連 出 版 物 ――― 光は大地に 麻生 鋭 9 山 と 水 （一） 沼津駅前から出る元箱根行のバスに、南チエと私とが乗った。 強羅の美術館へ桃山時代展を観に行こうというのである。目的は美術ばかりではない。山と水との間で遊んで行きたい。 途中、三島から、チエの亡夫の親友だったという医者が乗って来た。 チエは、その医者を、 「湯浅さんとおっしゃる外科の博士」と私に紹介して、 「湯浅さんは、少しおからだを悪くして、修善寺に来ていらっしゃるの」と説明した。 その湯浅さんは、五十恰好の温厚そうな紳士で、 「いいえ、病気ではないのですが、少し過労気味なので、保養に来ています。芦の湖へ行かないかという南さんのお話で、喜んでやって来ました」と言った。 「実は、私は南チエさんとは幼な友達で、遠慮のない間柄なものですから、今日もいじめられるのではないかと心配だったのです。あなたが御同行下されば、二対一、まずまず安心です」と、私も笑って言った。 「でも、妙なお二人の取り合わせで、箱根権現さまも戸惑いなさいますわ」と、チエが悪戯っ子のような眼をした。 「どうして妙な取り合わせなんです？」と、私はきいた。 「だって、あなたは精神派だし、湯浅さんは肉体派なのですもの」 「精神派というのも変な言葉だが、肉体派というのはどういうんですか。私だって、立派に肉体の尊厳は認めていますよ」と、私はチエにきいてみた。 「いや、南さんは、私が医者だからそういうのでしょう。毎日肉体を切開したり、縫合したりしていますから」と、湯浅さんが答えた。 「しかし、失礼ですが、肉体だけは扱えないでしょう。精神というものが確かにある以上は」と、私もはっきり言った。 「それは同じ医者でも、精神病科などは、文字通りに精神の病気を取り扱いますが、それにしても精神だけを取り出して見ることは出来ませんから、大脳小脳などを相手にするわけです」と、湯浅さんは素人にもわかるような言葉で言った。 「ですが、外科といえども精神を無視することは出来ないと思いますが……」 「どうしてですか。結核患者の肺葉切除をするのに、精神の方面を考える必要はありません。手術に堪えられるだけの肉体的抵抗力は十分考慮しますけれど……」 「ではなぜ、優しい看護婦を必要とするのですか。優しい看護婦は、病人の精神の安定のためにも極めて重要です。切開のあとも、優しい看護婦によって、早く癒着します」 「どうも、あなたは精神を重く見過ぎます。それでは、しまいには科学よりも信仰になってしまうでしょう」と、湯浅さんは語調を強めた。 「そうですとも。治ると信ずることは、既に半分は治ったことです」と、私も自信をもって答えた。 バスは、三島市内を出て、山中城のあとを走っている。 （二） 「でも、外科医が手術台の前に立って、いちいち患者の精神を問題にしてはいられません。痛いからいやだと言えば、麻酔薬をかがせるだけです。そして、これが医者の義務です。愛なのです」と、湯流さんは少し興奮したように言った。 「あなたば、ブルージェの、死の意味という小説をお読みになったでしょう」と、私は言った。 「いいえ」と、湯浅さんは首を振った。 そこで私は、こう言った。 「その小説の中で、エルネストという青年医師は、こう言っています。――死者と生者との間には永久の絶縁があるのか、それとも神秘的な関係があるのか、もしも眼に見えるこの世界の延長として霊界があるならば、死は別個の意昧をもつようになる。いや、こうした延長があってこそ、はじめて死は意味をもって来る。そう言っているのです。おわかりになりますか？」 すると、湯浅さんは、バスの窓のむこうを見て何か考えているようであったが、 「でも、それは死んで行く者の方の宗教観ではありませんか」と言った。 「そうです。しかし、それは同時に、手術台の前に立つ医者の宗教観でもあると思います。マカベ書に、われら心汚れざるうちに死なん、という言葉がありますが、それを裏返して医者の言葉にするならば、われら心汚れざるうちに甦らさん、となるのではないでしょうか」 私達の話を黙って聞いていたチエが、その時、 「芦の湖が見える」と叫んだ。 湯浅さんも私も、窓の外を見てみた。山かげから遠く下に、青い湖が、箱庭の池のように見えていた。 「いいわねえ」と、チエが言った。 「いいなあ」と、私も同じことを言った。 「頭がスーッとしますね」と、湯浅さんが、今までの理屈など忘れたように言った。 急勾配の坂道を、バスはすべるように降りて行く。山と山との間から、富士が顔を出している。それが水に映っている。箱根権現の赤い鳥居が、水に影を落している。岸のボートが、やっぱり水に映っている。 私はふと、形影相伴なうという古い言葉を思い出した。形が生で、影が死であろうか。それとも、影が生で、形が死であろうか。 道吾、漸源と某家に赴いて弔慰す。源、棺を叩いて言う、生か死か。吾、言う、生とも言われない、死とも言われない。 私の頭の中を、碧巌集の有名な問答が流れた。 生まれたと言っても、宇宙の原子一つ減らない。死んだと言っても、宇宙の原子一つ増さない。だが、生と死とは同じものと考えていいだろうか。 肉体を離れて精神はないと主張する人はまだいい。しかし、精神を離れても肉体はあると主張する人はどういう人だろうか。形がなければ影はないが、影があれば必ず形がある。 「さ、降りるのですよ」と、チエが言った。 ぼんやりしていた私は、あわてて降りた。 （三） バスを降りると、湖水添いの道を、私達はゆっくりと箱根権現の方へ歩いて行った。 「ここの権現様は何を祀ってあるの？」と、チエがきいた。 「ニニギノミコト、コノハナサクヤヒメ、それからヒコホホデミノミコト」と、私は答えた。 すると、湯浅さんが驚いたような顔で私を見て、 「くわしいですね、まるで神様の戸籍係みたいです」と言った。 「いや。実は昨日案内書を読んだら、そう書いてあったんですよ」と、私は笑った。 「それにしても、男神二柱に、女神一柱。三角関係ですか」と、湯浅さんが真面目くさって言った。 私は何か言ってみたくなった。それで、こんなことをしゃべってみた。 「たしかルカ伝だったと思いますが、こういう言葉があります。イエス言い給う、この世の子らは娶り嫁ぎすれど、かの世に入るに、死人の中よりよみがえるにふさわしとせらるる者は娶り嫁ぎすることなし、というのです。神は、おのれの形に似せて人間をつくったかも知れませんが、しかしその人間が、なんでも人間的にしか解釈しようとしないのは困ったものです」 「なるほど」 「例えば今、こうして私達三人が歩いている。これを見て、人間というものはすぐ言いたがるのです。あれは三角関係だろうなんてね」 「あら、私、木花咲耶姫なの？嬉しいわね」と、チエが少女のような声を出した。 しかし、私は続けて言った。 「このあいだ、世界メシヤ教の岡田教祖と話したんですが、その時教祖は、霊界には百八十段階があるというのです。私は妙な気がしましたよ。だがそれは、私が人間的にすべてを考えるからだということに気がつきました。ですから、そのあとで教祖が、ヨハネ――イナゴと野蜜を食べながらヨルダンの野でイエスを待っていた男ですね。そのヨハネが地獄界を出て今は煉獄界にいると言うのを聞いた時は、スーッと素直に胸に入りました」 「それはいい話だわね。私も、そういう素直な心が欲しいのよ」と、チエがしみじみ言った。 「そのくせ、人はダンテの神曲を読んで、ダンテが地獄界から天堂界へ上って行く壮麗な構想にはすっかり感心してしまうのですからね。ダンテは巧みに霊界を描いてはいますが、それを確かに見たとは言えないはずなのにね」と、私は湯浅さんに言った。 「では、あなたは、その岡田とかいう人は、本当に霊界を見ていると思っているのですか？」と、湯浅さんがきいて来た。 「それをどうして、この私が証言出来るでしょう。見ていると言えば、お世辞言ってると思うでしょうし、見えるものじゃないと言えば、盲が青空なんてないと言い張るのと同じになるかも知れないではありませんか」 その時、湯浅さんが、急に思い出したように、「メシヤ教では、医者にかかってはならぬという戒律があるそうですが……」と言った。 （四） 「それはちがいます」 私は、自分でもびっくりするような大きな声で、キッパリと言った。チエが、私の顔を見た。 「それはちがいます。メシヤ教に、そんな戒律はありません。医者にかかったら罰が当るぞなんて、教祖は一口も言ったことはありません。そういう脅迫宗教を、教祖は軽蔑しています。そうではないのです。ただ、薬は毒だと言っているだけです。医者にかかりたかったら、かかればいいのです。別に医者の営業を妨害はしません。けれども、薬さえのめばすべての病気は治るものだと信じ込んでいる人達に警告を発しているのです」 「私も医者ですから、薬にも毒があるということはよくわかっています。しかし、すべての薬が毒だとは、少々極端な言い方ではないでしょうか？」と、湯浅さんはおだやかに答えた。 「いや、わかります。あなた方は、薬は毒だと言うよりも、すべての毒も薬になると言いたいのでしょう。例えば砒素や青酸加里も治療に使っているとね」と、私もおだやかに声を落した。 「でも恐ろしいものね。新聞に出ていましたけれど、狂犬病予防のワクチンで、脳に空洞が出来る人もあるのですってねえ」と、今度はチエが言った。 三人は、いつか権現様の赤い鳥居をくぐっていた。参道の木立に青葉のにおいが漂っていた。 私達は、自然に議論をやめた。そして、古びた石段を上って行った。と、石段の横にシメ縄を張った大きな杉の木のあるのが眼についた。私達はたたずんだ。 すると、そこに立っている男の一人が、 「曾我の五郎が、子供の頃、この権現様に預けられてよ、この杉の大木を相手に撃剣の稽古をしたっていうが、本当かな？」と言った。 それを聞くと、もう一人の連れの男が、 「ほら、穴がいっばいある。きっと木刀で突いた跡だよ」と答えた。 「うん。なるほどね。突いた跡があれば、本当に稽古したんだろう」と、前の男がうなづいた。 私は憂鬱になった。これは木刀の跡ではない、何百年の風雨が削り取った肌の跡ではないか。だが人間というものは、なんてわびしいものだろう。なんでも証拠を見つけ出さなければ気が済まない。それでなければ信じないのだ。たとえ虫の食った跡でも、木刀で突いた穴にしてしまわなければ満足出来ないのだ。 「さ、行きましょう」と、チエが促した。 私達は又、高い石段を上って、めでたく参拝を済ませた。一応患者の精神は除外してメスを握る湯浅さんも、両手を合わせている。 帰りに、おみくじを引いた。 私は末吉が出た。チエは大吉で、ニコニコしていた。 「では、私も一つ……」と言って、湯浅さんが、ガラガラと箱を振った。 三十四番、大吉。願望、思うままなるべし。 「やっぱり大凶が出るより気持がいい」と、湯浅さんが正直なところを言った。 （五） 湖畔の休憩所で、簡単に中食を済ますと、三人は湖尻行の遊覧船に乗り込んだ。 甲板の椅子に腰を下すと、スピーカーから螢の光のレコードが流れ出て来た。 「行先はサンフランシスコ？ それともマルセーユ？」と、チエがはしゃいで言った。 「パリには、僕が置き去りにして来た金髪美人がいます」と、湯浅さんが冗談を言った。 「じゃ、マルセーユから一路花のパリヘ」と、チエが又はしゃいで言った。 「湯浅さんも薄情ですね。その金髪美人を連れて来ていれば、何も三角関係だろうなんて思われないで済むのに……」と、私もわざと唇をとがらせて見せた。 「そのかわり、南さんはあなたに取られます」と湯浅さんは、笑ったが、すぐ真剣な頻をして、 「さっきのお話ですね、薬は毒だという。――実はアメリカあたりでも、それを言っている医者がいます。チャールス・タイアールという大学教授なども、薬は病気を治さない、それは自然の治療機能を補助しないばかりか、それを遅らせる、と言っています。しかし、一般には、薬が毒だというよりは、薬の副作用に気をつけなさいといった方が親切ですね」と、だんだん移り変って行く山の景色をながめながら言った。 船は、いつか湖のまん中へ出ていた。チエは、ネッカチーフを頭からかぶって、まぶしそうに二子山の方を見上げていた。 「勿論、薬は毒だということは、薬のもつ副作用を言っているのです。しかし、結果においては同じでしょう。薬で寿命を縮めているのですから。以前、フランスのなんとかいう博士が、種痘をすると結核にかかり易くなると書いているのを読んだことがあります。素人考えで考えても、牛の天然痘を人間に感染させて全然副作用がないとは思えませんよ」と、私は答えた。 「しかし、薬は確かに病気を治しています」 「あれは治したのではない、奥の方へ押し込めただけだ、とメシヤ教では言うのです。そういうことはあると思います。敵を包囲して山奥に追い詰めたようなもので、まもなく猛然と反撃して来るかも知れませんね」 「そうしたら、もっと強力な武器でやっつけるだけですよ」と言って、湯浅さんは靴でトンと甲板を叩いた。 「いや、それは危険でしょう。新しい薬が次から次へと発見されますが、そのたびに病菌の抵抗力は増して来るじゃありませんか」 私は、結核の妙薬だというマイシン、パス、ヒドラジッドなどのことを考えながら言った。 「しかし、殺人剣すら活人剣に使うのが、私達の仕事です」 「人を活かすのに、なぜ殺人剣など使わなければならないのでしょうか。人を活かすには、活人剣だけでいいじゃありませんか」 この時、船は湖尻の桟橋に着いた。 「さあさあ、議論はバスの中へ移して頂きます」と、チエがふざけて言つた。 （六） バスへ乗って、女車掌が切符を切りに来た時、 「どうでしょう。大湧谷で降りてみようじゃないですか？」と、私は言った。 「いいですね」と、湯流さんが答えた。 「私は初めからそのつもりよ」と、チエがずるそうな眼をした。 切符を三枚買って、私は、 「とにかく、この地球の中心が火だということは驚くべきことですよ」と、湯浅さんに言った。 「鉱物を溶かした熱湯が、地面の上に噴き出して来るんだから、たいしたエネルギーです」と、湯浅さんが答えた。 「そうですよ。この壮麗な天地をつくった者が、人間でないということは万人が認めますが、生物をつくった者が生物自身だと思い込んでいるのは滑稽ですよ」と、私は一部の科学者を念頭に置いて言った。 「生物は、生物がつくっているのではありません。ただ、その生命のくさりを断ち切らないように、種族の保存をしているだけです」と、湯浅さんも私の考えを補足した。 「ところが、科学者の中には、人間はアミーバから進化したなんていう人もいますよ」 「昆虫記を書いたファーブルね。ファーブルは、そんなことは言ってないわ」と、側からチエが口を入れた。 「そうさ。謙虚な科学者は、生命の神秘が神の手の中のものであることを知っている。ただ、神と言わずに、ほかの言葉で言っているだけですよ」と、私は強く言い切った。 それっきり、私達は黙った。地表を突き破って噴出している怒りの神の息が、間近かに感じられたからである。 「あ、見えます」と、湯浅さんが言った。 窓から見ると、熔岩の山から、濛々として硫黄の白煙が立ち上っている。 私達はバスを降り、そこの茶店でウイスキーの瓶を買うと、白煙の方へと歩いて行った。 「水爆は二十世紀の宗教だって言ってる人がありますね」と、私ば口惜しい気持で言った。 「太陽をつくった者、星をつくった者が、笑ってるわ」と、チエも同じことを言った。 熱湯の噴き出しているところまで来ると、私たちはベンチに腰を下して、ウイスキーを甜めながら、宇宙は自分を中心にして拡がっていると思い込んでいる小賢かしい人間どもを憐れんだ。 「そうじゃないんですよ。同じようなことでも、こう考えなければいけないんです。この人間という生物を、宇宙構造の中心に置いてくれたのは神だということを。その神を讃美しないでいられるでしょうか？」と、私は少し酔って言った。 「私は科学者なので、どうもそういう言い方にはテレるんです。だから、こう言わせて下さい。何かがある、だがその何かがわからないから、一応除外して考えるとね」 そういう湯浅さんも、ほんのり赤い顔をしていた。何かに感動していた。 （七） 茶店の女の子が、卵を入れた籠を抱えて来て、熱湯で茹でている。 「あれ、食べましょうよ」と、チエが言った。 「別段、味に変りはないらしい」と、私はひとり言のように言った。 「あら、あなたまでそんなことを言うの？ 味もまた精神よ」と、チエが笑った。 「あははは。その通りだ。こういう雄大な山の上で、温泉で茹でた卵を食べると寿命が延びる。味は感覚以外の何物でもないという人は哀れむべし。その証拠には、心配事があれば飯もまずいが、綺麗なひとと、静かに音楽の流れる部屋で食べれば、カツレツなど十枚も食べられる。もっとも、その綺麗なひとがあまり好きだと、胸がいっぱいになって、却って食べられないがね」 そう言いながら、こいつは少しウィスキーが回り過ぎたかなと、私は苦笑した。 「いや、修善寺に来たのもそうで、いくらあの湯と同じ成分の温泉でも、東京のゴミゴミしたところじゃ、保養にはならないでしょう。結局は、カルシウムとか硫黄とか塩分とかじゃなくて、目に青葉、山ほととぎすなんですね」と、湯浅さんも浮き浮きして言った。 「そうですよ。人間て、そういうものですよ。それでいいんですよ。患者を手術台に乗せた時は、厳然たる肉体派だと思っているでしょうが、実ばそういうあなたも、あなたの言う何者かに祈っているんです。この帝王切開、どうかうまく行くように……って」 「そうかも知れません。いや、多分そうでしょう。自分で意識していないだけでしょう」と、湯浅さんは素直に答えた。 茹で上った卵を、女の子が三つ持って来た。やっぱり、おいしかった。 「ウイスキーのおかずにゆで卵というのは、少し変ですね」と、私は湯浅さんを見た。 「ゆで卵なんて言わないで、卵のお料理でサントリーと言えば、ちっともおかしくないことよ」と、チエが嘴を入れた。 「人間は弱いものなんですね。言葉一つで、うまくもなったり、まずくもなったり……」と、湯浅さんがしんみりと言った。 「いや。だから人間は強いんでしょう。言葉一つで、勇躍死地にも飛び込みます」と、私は戦場のことを考えながら言った。 湯浅さんの頭にも、万歳を叫んで倒れる兵士のことがひらめいたのだろう、急に思い出したような顔で、 「南さんは再婚なさらないのですか？」と、きいた。 「………………」 チエは、ただ静かに微笑した。 「このあいだから縁談話が持ち上っていたようですが、チエさんはことわったそうです」と、私が代って言った。 「南君はいい男でしたよ。流れ弾などで死なせたくなかった。ああいういい旦那様はめったにないですよ。だから、南さんが再婚したくない気持もよくわかります」と、湯浅さんは遠い日の友情を思い出すように言った （八） “再婚したくない気持？” チエは、人間のこころの奥底など自分にだってわからないのに、と思った。そして、こんなことを考えていた。 “私にも尊敬する人はある。好きな人もある。しかし、私があの縁談を断わったのは、あの時、亡夫の声が聞こえたからだ。夫は決して死んでいないという証拠を見たからだ。あの不思議な経験で、私の人生観は変った。死は、死でない……” その時、湯浅さんが、私に、 「あなたの研究していられるメシヤ教ですね。あの教団では、生きている者と死んだ者との関係をどう説明しているんですか？」ときいた。 チエが、湯浅さんの顔を見た。自分も今、それを考えていたのだと言いたいような眼であった。 私は、少し考えてから、こんな受け売りをしゃべってみた。 「人間は、死んであの世へ行った人と霊線でつながっているというのです。霊線とは、霊魂の線という意味ですが、この世の人間同志も、互いにこの霊線でつながっているのですね。だから、ここに一人の人間がいるとすると、その人は自分につながっている霊線を、何十本か、何百本かもっているわけです。夫と妻とをつなぐ霊線、親と子をつなぐ霊線、兄弟と姉妹とをつなぐ霊線。友人知己、先生と弟子、男と女……沢山あります。そして、この霊線には、太い細い、長い短い、正しいもの邪悪なものなどがあって、それが絶えず人間と人間、あるいは生者と死者のあいだに影響を与えているのです。霊線のうちでも、夫婦をつなげている霊線が一番太いのですが、それがいつも一定しているとは言えません。仲のいい時は太くて光がありますが、不仲になると細くなって光も薄らんでしまいます。恋愛が高潮して行くというのは、互いの霊線がだんだん太く輝いて来るからで、例えばチエさんが亡くなった御主人と話したというのも、考えてみればなんでもないことなんですね。電話の声が、電線を伝わって来るようなものですから。えらい人が死ぬと、お隠れになると言いますね。私はこの言葉が好きです。確かに人間は、死んでなくなってしまうのじゃなくて、私達の眼から隠れてしまうだけでしょうから」 「神道では、あの世のことを、根の国と言うようですが、やはりそういう意味でしょうか？」と、湯浅さんがきいた。 「そうですね。根の国というくらいだから根本的な場所――言い換えれば、人間が生まれて来て、又帰って行く場所というわけですね」 「帰ったら、もうそれでおしまいですか？」 「メシヤ教では、再生霊ということを言います。帰って行った霊は、再びこの世に戻って来るからです。勿論、再生霊ばかりではありません。霊界では常に新霊が生まれていて、それが体を得てこの世に来るのです。過去に人間的経歴をもたない本当の新生人間ですね」 私達は立ち上った。 茶店のところまで戻り、早雲山行のバスに乗った。 （九） 早雲山でバスを降りて、ケーブルカーに乗ろうとした時、私はうしろから、「先生」と呼びとめられた。 ふりかえると、谷口葉子が笑って立っていた。 「先生、本当にお久しぶりでした」と、葉子が頭を下げた。 「奇遇だね。びっくりしたよ」と、私は葉子の肩を叩いた。 葉子は、戦時中、私が東京から静岡へ疎開して来た時、家が隣だったので、私はモンペ姿の彼女が、買い出しのリュックを背負って帰って来るところなどを、よく見た。 空襲の晩は、お互いにどうしたか知らないが、翌朝わが家へ戻って来てみると、私の家も葉子の家も焼かれず、彼女はまっくろな顔をして、庭土に突き刺さった焼夷弾を掘り出していた。 その後、私が物を書いているのを知って、遮蔽幕で外を暗くした私の書斎へ遊びに来るようになった。母親との二人暮らしで、その頃葉子は二十四であった。 それから二年ほどして、葉子は東京へ嫁いで行った。いとまごいに来て、「母も一緒に住むようになりました」と喜んでいた。 その時から、もう七年近くたっている。毎年、年賀状は貰っていたが、家庭の事情も聞いたことはなく、こんなところで会おうとは思わなかった。 「遊びに来たの？」と、私は言った。 「ええ、会社のお友達と」と、葉子が、少し離れたところに立っている同年ぐらいの女を指した。 「葉ちゃん、会社へ勤めてるの？」と、私は意外なような気持できいた。 「ええ、もう五年も前から」 「旦那様は？」 「別居しています」と、葉子は小さな声で言った。 「別居？ どうしたっていうの」 私は驚いてたずねた。 しかし、葉子はそれには答えなかった。 「先生も遊びに？」と、話題を変えるように、あどけなく笑って言った。 「強羅の美術館――知ってるだろう。世界メシヤ教でもってる美術館だ。今、桃山時代展をやっているんでね、二、三人で観に来た」 「もう御覧になったの？」 「いや、これから行くんだ。沼津からバスで、芦の湖の方を回って来たんでね」 「私も、観たいわ」と、葉子が言った。 「お友達を呼びなさい。みんなで観ようじゃないか」と、私はケーブルカーが上って来たのを見ながら言った。 その時、チエが、停車場の前で、 「ケーブルカーが来ましたよ。早くいらして下さい」と言うのが聞こえた。 みんなケーブルカーに乗った。 車の中で、私は湯浅さんとチエを葉子に紹介した。葉子は、連れの友達を私達に紹介した。 車は動き出した。窓の外の風景が、斜め下から斜め上へと過ぎて行く。 「霊線というやつは、要するにケーブルカーだと思えばいいんでしょう」と、湯浅さんが私にささやいた。 （十） 美術館の中では、みんなあまり物を言わなかった。 「素晴しいですね」 「あら、いいわねえ」 「美しいなあ」 「いいなあ」 そういう嘆声だけで、私達は互いに満足していた。美しいものの中で、五つの心は五つとも、美しいものに酔っていた。 しかし、見終って休憩室の椅子に腰を下すと、溜っていた水が一度にセキを越して流れるように、私達は美の神への讃歌を歌い出した。 「光悦の新しさはどうです。実に大胆じゃありませんか」と、まず私が言った。 「そうです。あの蒔絵の硯箱の図案の大胆さにはびっくりしました。本阿弥光悦の描法は、当時の人にも驚異を与えたでしょうが、今だって新しいのだから驚きますよ」と、湯浅さんも 「膳所という銘だったでしょうか、光悦の楽茶わん、私は本当に惚れぼれしてしまいました」と、私は重ねて言った。 「宗達の寒山拾得もよかったわねえ」と、チエが眼を細くして言った。 「宗達では、双幅の龍虎もよかったですわ」と、続いて葉子が言った。 「そうだね。あの簡素な筆が、実は密画よりも細かい用意の下で動かされているということ。たまらなく好きだ」と、私はその葉子に言った。 「達磨。宮本武蔵の画いた達磨ね。私はあれにも驚きましたわ」と、チエが湯浅さんを見て言った。 「とにかく素晴しいものですよ。剣をとっても天下一、筆をとってもあの通りなんですからね」と、湯浅さんが言った。 「岩佐又兵衛の堀江物語の絵巻物ですけれど、ガラス箱の上から眺めていて、溜息がガラスに白くついてしまいました」と、葉子の友達が、静かに言った。 「あれが果して又兵衛の筆になるものかどうかは疑問だが、とにかくあの仕事の丁寧さは、ちょっと真似が出来ない」と、私はその方を見て言った。 「長次郎の赤楽茶わんもよかったですな。天狗の銘の……」と、今度は湯浅さんが言った。 「陶器のうちでは、私は織部の水指に感心してしまったわ。二つあったけれど……」と、チエが私を見て言った。 「重要文化財になっている海北友松の屏風が忘れられませんわ」と、葉子が言った。 「みんな忘れられないよ」と、私が、その葉子に言った。 「楽しかったわ。山と水……今日一日のこと、みんな忘れられないわ」と、チエが言った。 美術館を出ても、私達は、素晴しい、素晴しいを繰り返した。 そして、小田原まで電車で下り、国鉄のホームで、東と西に別れた。 湯浅さんと葉子とその連れの女は、上り列車に乗った。チエと私は、下り列車に乗った。 「沼津で下りて、春秋寺を訪ねてみることにしたよ」と、車の中で私はチエに言った。 「ああ、いつかあなたが話していた面白い坊さんのいるお寺ね」と、チエがうなづいた。

――― 関 連 出 版 物 ――― 中島一斉先生 ――その信仰と生涯―― 麻生 鋭 伝記こそわが恋人 財団法人 新宗連専務理事 大石秀典 先人の捨身精進の跡をさぐり、そこから、自分の信仰の至らざるを厳しくむちうち、求道の心を燃えあがらせてもらえるような糧を汲みとりたいと、いつも願っているせいか、宗教家の語録や伝記を特に好んで読むのが、私のくせである。 そのほうが、深遠な高尚な、しかし冷たい聖典や教義書を読むよりは、はるかに素晴らしい感動にゆすぶられ、じぶんの今だしを深刻に反省させられることが多い。おそらく、法を求め道をたずねる人たちのうちには、私と同じような傾向をもっている人が多いのではあるまいか。 そんなわけで、心をくだき身を削って道をわけ登った宗教家の伝記が出されるということは、その道の人から云ってもその道の人でないものから云っても、まことにうれしいものである。 ところがその伝記であるが、昔は文明が高度でなかったから、宗祖とか教祖とかいわれる人や偉大な宗教家の伝記は、幾世代にもわたる弟子たちの手を経てつくられ、さらに、それが筆写によって求道者から求道者へと伝わったのであるから、おそらく、広く読まれるようには何十年も、ときには何百年もの歳月を要したことであろう。 然るに、今は、紙もあり余るほどあり、鉛筆もあればペンもあり、そのうえまた、テープレコーダーや印刷術が非常に発達しているのであるから、沢山な伝記が短日月の間に出版されてもよい筈である。にもかかわらず、一般の出版物にくらべて伝記の方は、極めて少ないように思われる。これは、伝記を書くということがたいへんに困難なためなのではないであろうか。 伝記を書くことについての困難性は、いろいろある。私などは、記憶力が人並みはずれて弱いせいか、じぶんのことのくせに、過去の大事なことでも殆ど忘れてしまっている。たんねんに日記でもつけていない限り、よほど印象のつよかったもののほかは、ボンヤリしてしまっているのが、世の人のさがではあるまいか。してみると、なくなってしまった人の生前のあれもこれもを正確にたずねるということは、難中の難事といってもよかろう。 特に宗教家の場合には、その人の歴年譜よりも、その心がどのように変化し、あるいは、その信仰がどのように深まり高まりあっていったかという、どちらかといえば、ほかの人には見えない心の中のことが重大であるだけに、その心のうちにまでふみこんで正鵠を得るということは、常人には手のとどかないことかも知れない。かといって、自分勝手に立ち入りすぎて想像をたくましうすれば、伝記小説になってしまう。しかも宗教家の伝記では、歴年譜よりも、この困難極まることのほうが重要なのであるから、宗教家の伝記を書くことほど始末におえないことはないと言ってもよかろう。 信仰は、理論ではなく、体験の領分のことだから、その人が高くいっていればいるほど、深くいっていればいるほど、書こうとする人にとっては、とりつくしまもなく、絶望にうちひしがれることもあろう。 この中島一斉先生の伝記の筆者である麻生さんは、その絶望的困難をおして、しかも、一年に足らない短日月の間に、調査し研究し、資料を整理して、これだけのものを書きあげたのであるから、その勇気と努力には、心から敬意を表せざるを得ない。 また、おそらく、企画の方から分量の制限をうけていたのであろうが、中島先生を直接には殆ど知らない麻生さんが、これだけの文章のうちに、余すところなくとでも言いたいほど中島先生の真骨頂を伝え誌しえた、その力量にもただ頭をさげるばかりである。 こうして書いている文章自身が暴露しているように、私の文章は、一文の句切りが長くて、書き出しと結末をつなぐのに、読者は苦労されるであろう。いわばズルズルベッタリの文章である。だから、読む人に興味も感動も与えない。読み終えて、さてなにが書いてあったのだろうと思うのが、オチである。 それにひきかえ、麻生さんの文章は、一文の句切りが極めて短い。いわゆるハギレの良い文章で、読む人に強い印象を与える迫力をもっている。いわば、これが、今と、そしてこれからの文章のあり方なのである。 私が、いつも自分の構文の欠点に悩んでいるせいか、特に、この書物の麻生さんの、簡潔で、しかも淡淡として、妙に力んでいない文章に、強く心をひかれるのである。 ただ欲を言わせてもらえば、これは正規の伝記であるから、文中に出てくる人には、みんな、本名をいれてもらいたかった。もっとも、それらの人たちが、いまだ生存しておられて、さしさわりがあったのなら、仕方のないことでもあったろうが。 さて、救世教からは、本格的な教祖伝は、まだ刊行されていない。 これは、救世教のみでなく、一般に、教祖を霊界に見送ってしまった教団で、その教祖伝に関連して思うことは、教祖から救われ、親しく教えを受けた直弟子がたが、まだ霊界に旅立たれない間に、その一代記を、特に教祖を中心に意識した信仰記を、やがてそれが教祖伝の重要な資料になるという意味で、今から作っておいたらどうであろうかということであろうかということである。今は、録音機という便利手軽なものがあるのであるから、昔の人たちの骨身を削る思いの労苦にくらべれば、なんでもないとも言えるくらいのことであろう。 中島先生は、すでにこの世になく、その伝記の筆者の麻生さんが直接先生にあって調べたわけではないから、この書物にそうした教祖観を求めるのは無理な話である。しかし、ともかく、先生の十年祭を記念するものとして、この伝記を刊行された中島先生門下のかたがたにも、これは先生に対するご恩報謝であるとともに、教団に対しても一つの大きい功績であると敬意を表したい。 さて救世教で私の始めて会ったかたは、渋井総斉先生である。昭和二十三年の暮れもおし迫った頃、ある方に随行して玉川上野毛の宝山荘であったか、あそこで、いわば非公式に会ったのである。それから、公式にも非公式にも、度々、おあいする機会があった。それは渋井先生のほうが中島先生より長命であられたからである。 それにくらべると、中島先生には、昭和二十四年の秋頃から、二度くらいしか、おあいする機会はなかった。 この伝記にも、それらしい場面が出ているのであるが、最後に、箱根の旅館で私が中島先生の訪問をうけて、二人の間で宗教論が出ようとしたところで、急な要用のために先生が帰ってしまわれた事を今でもハッキリ覚えている。まことに口おしい分れで、大変残念に思っている。 この時に、先生には、この若ぞうを……と言っても、私は先生より四つしか年下でないのだが、信仰という面から、先生は、きっと、私をそう見られただろうと思っているのであるが……説服せずにおくものかという気迫が見えた。私は、無心というか、構えのない構えで対していたと思っているが、しかし、あの夜、先生に暇があって、心ゆくまで説き来り説き去って、ということになっていたら、どんなことになっていたろうと、その時のことを思い出すたびに、今でも、総身がひきしまる思いがするのである。 とにかく、それだけのことであったが、宗教家としては、めづらしく厳しい、しかも行事綿密というか、そんな印象が今でも強く残っている。 何かのことで、中島先生のことを思い出すと、その宗教をくらべるわけではないが、中島先生は、宗教家としては、道元禅師のような風格というのか、そんな型のかたであったろうと思えてならない。おなくなりになった年令もほぼ同じである。 中島・渋井という岡田教祖の二大弟子を考えないでは、救世教は考えられないほどのかたであったわけ〔で〕あるが、ちょうど、お釈迦さまより先に、その二大弟子であった舎利弗尊者と目連尊者とがこの世を去ってしまったのに似て、お一人は教祖さんより先に、霊界に行ってしまわれた。言わば、教祖さんの露払いの役をなされた。そしてもうお一人は教祖さんの昇天の直後に、これは太刀持とでも言う姿で他界された。まことにおしみても余りあることであった。もしも、お二人が現存しておられたとしたら、救世教の地図はどう変わっていただろうと思うことがある。これも凡夫の愚痴であろうか。 しかし、いまでも、教祖さんが救世教に生きておられると同様に、中島先生も、救世教の多くの信者さんのうちに生きていられるのである。 そして、さらにまた、この伝記によって、先生は、これからも、いつまでも、ひろく強く生き続けていかれるであろう。 昭和三十六年七月二十三日 はじめに 「中島先生の生涯の指導原理は？」と訊かれれば、「それは良心であった」と答えたい。 良心――それが先生の至上命令であった。 これは信仰に入らない前も、そうであったし、信仰に入ってからも、そうであった。 先生は、常に、良心という鏡の前で、強く反省し、鞭うち続けた。この点、自分というものに対して、あまりに峻厳であり過ぎた。 同様に、相手に対しても、あまりに峻厳であり過ぎた。容赦なく、強く反省を求め、鞭うった。弱い弟子は落伍した。 ただ、信仰に入らない前は、あくまでも自力で、自分というものの完成が出来ると考えていたが、信仰に入ってからは、その自力ですらも、すべて神の支援によってのみ可能であるということを知った。 言い換えるならば、土俵に上ったからには、全力を出して相撲をとらなければならないが、相手は誰か、そして勝星はどちらのものかは、すべて神の計画の中のものであることを悟ったのであった。 もともと、先生は、性格的にも激情の人であった。中途半端のままでいることの出来ない人であった。すべてか、然らずんば、無の人であった。 例えば、一生を過すにも、燈心をひたした皿に油を満たし、それに火をつけて、自他共に安穏に照らして生きるということを、いさぎよしとしなかった。そういうやり方では、満足することが出来なかった。むしろ己の「身をえぐり、肉を出して、深さ大銭の如からしめ。蘇油（そゆ）以て中にそそぎ、千燈柱をつくって」（仏祖統記）燃えようとした。自分自身を、ぼうぼうと燃やし尽くそうとした。肉は焼け、骨もあらわになる。 先生は、これこそ、男の本懐と考えた。 しかし、信仰が、先生を変えた。 良心を人生指針とすることに変りはなかったが、そのために極度に自分をいじめることを、先生はやめた。「自己拷問」から脱け出した。 信仰は、まず、先生に、生きていることの喜びと感謝を湧かせた。自分という人間を生かせてくれる者への深い感謝が、先生を明るくした。人生に微笑が訪れた。 その先生が、晩年、こう書いている。 「笑いは天国です。大いに笑い、大いに笑わせましょう。最初は、嘘でもいいのです。おかしくなくても笑いなさい。面白くなくても笑いなさい。それでは偽りだという譏（そし）りがあるかもしれないが、それでもいいのです。最初から、なんでも本物はないのです。嘘も本物になるのです。みんな心から笑えるようになれば、それが天国です。明らかに、上品に、大いに笑い、笑わせましょう」 しかし、良心は、生涯、先生の生命の根本であった。良心の命ずる行為の中にこそ神は住み給うと、弟子たちに教えた。 「信仰の極致――それは、腹の中に汚い塵や垢を洗い落し、澄みきった心となって、ひたすら大愛の神に誠を捧げること。言いかえるならば、“行”の中で行きぬくこと」 先生は、いつもそう言った。 まことに、先生こそ、良心の人、行の人である。真の意味のおいて、身を削って生きた大修行者であった。 一 一斉・中島武彦は、明治三十二年二月二十六日、山口県萩の川島という静かな農村に生れた。 中島家は、遠く藤原鎌足を祖先とする旧家で、吉田松陰の家系ともつながりがあり、父の善三郎氏は、村の小学教員をしていたが、漢学の造詣が深く、特に詩作を好み、乞われるままに史記、十八史略などを村民に教えた。 晩年、同じ萩の川上小学校長となったが、中風のため五十五歳で歿した。 母のあきさんは、同郷田中氏の息女で、長男武彦に続いて、貞子、寿子、謙二、慶介の四児を挙げた。現在八十六歳、箱根強羅の山荘で、平和な余生を送っている。 先生は、まるまると肥った、可愛い赤児であった。 萩の郊外に、一般に「塩湯」と呼んでいた温泉場があった。 ある時、母親は、生れたばかりの赤児を、それへ連れて行った。 湯につかっていると、湯治に来ている女の客は、 「なんて可愛い赤ちゃんでしょう。抱かせてくださいな」 そう言って、赤児を抱きたがった。 どの女の客も、みんなそうしたがった。 誰でも頬ずりしたくなるような、そんな可愛い赤児であった。 赤児は、丈夫で、胎毒もなく、すくすくと育って行った。 「本当に、手のかからない子ですよ」 母親は、そう自慢した。 そう自慢するだけあって、風邪一つ引かない丈夫な子であった。 数え年七つで父が勤めていた川島小学校に入学したが、頭がよく、学課の成績はよかった。 家でも、よく言うことをきく、世話のかからない少年であった。 ただ、負けることが嫌いで、その時分、剣道を習い初め、土地の警察署の道場へ出かけて、竹刀を振り回していたが、負けるととても口惜しがった。 だから､上達は早かった。試合に出て、褒美をもらったこともあった。 習字も好きで、よく手習いをしていたが、これも負けじ魂のあらわれで、六年生の時、教育勅語を立派に書いて出して、学校から賞を貰って帰って来た。 とにかく、人に負けるということが大嫌いであった。それは、どうにも我慢のならないことであった。 しかし、素直であった。 曲がったことには、何処までもぶつかって行くが、そうでないことには、至って素直で、むしろ同情心が強過ぎるくらいであった。 人に物をやるのが好きで、手もとにあるものは、片っぱしからやってしまう。 アコーデオンもやってしまえば、空気銃もやってしまった。気前のいい少年であった。 両親にも愛され、学校の先生にも愛されて、幸福な毎日であった。六年を卒業するまで、三番とは下らなかった。 二 少年は、萩中学へ進んだ。 中学でも、出来る生徒であった。 二年の時、軍人を志望して、幼年学校の試験を受けた。 試験の成績はよかったが、体格審査ではねられた。 「君は、成績がいいが、惜しいことに視力が弱い。主計なら、合格させてやるが、どうだ」 試験官は、そう言った。 少年は、黙って、引き下がってきた。 （主計じゃいやだ。主計なんか、軍人じゃない） 少年は、意気消沈して、試験場の山口から家まで、十三里の道を、歩きづめに歩いて帰ってきた。 帰ってくると、玄関に立ったまま、しくしく泣き出した。 母親は、びっくりした。 （くやしい、くやしい） 少年は、言葉には出さず、いかにも口惜しそうに、いつまでも泣いていた。 少年は軍人になるのをあきらめて、又学校へ戻った。こつこつと勉強しつづけた。 中学を卒業する時、受持の教師は、 「君は、学課の成績がいいし、将来大いに伸びると思う。どうだ、同文書院へ入って見ないか」と言った。 事実、少年には、大陸に雄飛したいという夢があった。入れるものなら、それへの最短距離として、中国の同文書院へ入りたいと考えた。そして、そのことを両親に相談した。 父親は、反対した。 「お前は長男だ。そんな遠くへ行かなくてもよろしい」と言うのであった。 「あきらめます」 少年は、素直に、そう返事した。しかしやっぱり悲しかった。 仕方なく、母校の萩中学校の代用教員になった。自分と余り年の差のない生徒を教えていた。 しかし、青雲の志は、やっぱりなくなってはいなかった。なくなるどころか、火山の地底のように、ふつふつと燃えたぎっていた。 （こんな小さな農村で、一生朽ち果てろというのだろうか。おれは、いやだ。いやだ） そこで、その代用教員生活も、一年程でやめて、上京した。 先生、この時、十九才。 父の善三郎と、当時ブラジル大使であった田付七太氏とが、同郷同窓の関係にあったので、父の紹介で、その田付家の書生になって勉強する心組みであった。 そして、その心組みの中には、大使の力にすがって南米方面に出て働きたいという希望も、そっと隠されていた。 上京して、書生になると、先生は明治大学の商科を選んで、そこに通った。ブラジル、メキシコ、アルゼンチン……。先生は、その夢に胸をふくらませて、勉強を続けた。 しかし、夢は、僅か二年で、もろくも崩れてしまった。厳父の死に遭ったばかりでなく、思いもかけない脚気を患ってしまったのである。しかも、相当の重症である。 やむなく、先生は、療養のため、郷里に引き上げた。 退屈で、若い命を包むには余りに刺激のない農村ではあったが、しかし、空気は清らかで、吹く風にも、流れる小川にも、静かな田園の平和があった。 そして、やがて、脚気も全快した。 しかし、一度崩れた夢は、もう再びはふくれ上がって来ない。先生は、あきらめた。 （おれは一生、サラリーマンで終るのだろうか。いやなことだ。だが、仕方がない） 先生は下関の図書館に口を見つけて、その雇人となった。 本が読めるのは嬉しかった。本の中で暮らしているのだから、読もうと思えば、どんな本でも手近にあった。 けれども、心は慰まなかった。この生活を愉しいとは思えなかった。 （本の虫。紙虫。おれは、月給の虫か） 先生は、自ら嘲って、早くこんな毎日から足を洗いたいものだと考えた。 図書館づとめは、二年でやめた。 三 先生のいとこが、久原鉱業の重役の夫人になっていた。 その縁で図書館をやめた先生は、久原鉱業へ入ったが、同県の先輩で、当時羽振りのよかった山田某に見込まれて、まもなく、大同電力へ移った。そして、名古屋へ出た。二十二才の時であった。 仕事に夢はなかったが、せっせと働いた。 それから三年たって、二十五才の時、先生は、この土地の大きな綿布問屋の娘である暉世子さんと結婚した。 「結婚式の始まる三十分前に婚姻届を出すようにするから、そのつもりで実印を用意して来なさい」 初めからそういう先生であった。 当時の名古屋では、子供が出来て初めて籍を入れるというのが普通のやり方であった。だが、何事でも几帳面でなければ承知できない先生であった。 さて、式はとどこおりなく済み、東照宮社務所で披露の宴が開かれた。 席上、先生は、花婿らしくもなく飲んだ。 花嫁は、ただはらはらしていた。 その時、花嫁の兄さんが、 「妹を頼みますよ。私のかわいい妹ですからね。本当にいい妹ですよ」と、血を分けた妹の将来を頼んだ。 それを聞くと、先生は、大きな目を更に大きくして、義兄となったその人をにらみつけた。 「いい妹、いい妹と、そんなに嫁にやるのが惜〔し〕いなら、さっさと連れて帰れ」 先生の声が大きかったので、まわりの者はなにごとかといぶかった。 ちょっと座が白けた。 先生は、そんなことには頓着なく、飲んでいた。 披露の宴の席上、先生はどうしてそんなに酔いたいのだろうか。それには理由があった。 息子の嫁を迎えるのに、暉世子さんではと、母親が反対の態度をとっていた。式にも出て来てくれなかった。 先生には、それが面白くなかった。面白くないというよりは、寂しくて、やりきれない思いであった。 そこへ酒が入った。先生は、花婿らしくもなく飲んだ。これでいいのだと思い、これからの女房教育が大変だとも思っていた。 その晩、家へ帰った先生は、厳かな顔で新妻に言い渡した。 「あしたからは絶対に名古屋弁をつかってはならぬ。紅白粉をつけてはならぬ。留守は責任をもって守ってもらわなければならぬ」 この三つの命令のうち、あとの二つはともかくとして、最初の一カ条――「名古屋弁を使うことも、まかりならぬ」は暉世子夫人にとって到底自信の持てないものであった。不意に口に出る名古屋弁をも許さないというのであろうか。 名古屋に生まれ、名古屋で育った女にとって、明日から絶対に名古屋弁を使ってはならないと言われることは、無理を要求されているようなものである。悪く考えれば、できないことをやれといういじのわるい脅迫ではないかとさえ思った。 しかし先生の要求は至上命令である。 「はい。かならずそういたします」 式服を脱いだばかりの新妻は、覚悟をきめて、そう答えた。答えなければならない厳しい空気がそこにあった。 翌日から、夫人はそれを実行した。 名古屋弁が出そうになると、咽喉のところまででその禁制の言葉を呑み込み、改めて標準語に直して、それからやっと物が言えるのであった。 それだけではない。 先生は、さっそく家計簿をつけるように命じた。命じたばかりではない。毎晩、その日の家計簿を点検して、これでよしという判を捺さなければ寝なかった。夫人も悪びれはしなかった。それならばそれで完璧な家計簿を見てもらおうと決意し、商業学校で習得した腕にものを言わせて、丹念に記帳し続けた。 一カ月たった。 「うん。これでよし」と先生は、満足そうに言った。 そしてそれからは、点検はもちろん、家計に関することは一切、妻にまかせてしまった。 当時、先生の俸給は八十五円で、家賃は二十五円であった。 四 大同電力でサラリーマン生活を続けていた先生は、再び、山田某に勧められて、東京神田神保町にあったフォード自動車会社の代理店のセールスマンになった。そして来る日も来る日も、自動車の売り込みに駆けずりまわった。 しかし、セールスマンは、もともと先生の性格には合わない。勤めたからには一生懸命やろうと思い、またその通り一生懸命やるのであったが、しかし性分に合わないものはどうにも仕方なく、胸の奥にはいつも穴のようなものがぽっかりと口をあけていた。 「ぼくはとうとう雲助になり下がってしまった」と先生は笑って自分にも言い、友人にも言った。その笑いは、青梅のようにすっぱい笑いであった。 セールスマン。 普通の人なら、それほど自嘲しなくてもいい仕事であるが、いい意味にも悪い意味にも潔癖すぎる先生にとっては、口八丁、手八丁で品物を売り込むというその仕事が恥ずかしくてならないのであった。自分がまるで箱根山中で酒代をねだる雲助のような境涯に堕ちてしまったように思われ、いつもいらいらしていた。 そういう先生を見、はじめフォード自動車会社代理店に入れた山田某も、溜息をついて言った。 「中島君、君は結局、坊主か牧師になるほうがいいかも知れないね」 事実、先生の心の底には、何か宗教的なものが芽生えつつあった。しかし、それは一つの星が出来上がる前のもやもやした雲のようなもので、自分でもその本体が掴めず、ただひとりでいら立っていた。 しかし、とにかく働かねばならない。 働かねば食べていけない。 そして、疲れて、妻の待つ麹町土手三番町の家に帰って来るのであった。 結婚四年目、ここで長女の三保子さんが生まれた。 仕事は面白くなかったが、初めての赤児だけに先生の喜びも大きく、気分的にも明るくなったとみえて、こんな冗談を言った。 「暉世子も辰年だし、三保子も辰年だ。ぼやぼやしていると、おれは竜にやられてしまうぞ」 先生も、もう三十才である。 本当の心の平和がほしい。落ちつきたい。 しかし、外面はとにかく、先生の胸の中にはまだもやもやしたものがあった。いつまでも十を三で割っているような、そんないらだたしさもあった。明るくはなったというものの、それは雲の多い日の空に似ていた。先生は、可愛い赤児を膝に乗せながらも、被害妄想者のように、自分で自分をいじめた。 （これでいいのか、これで） （この生活で満足しろというのか） 先生は、唇を噛むようにして、じっと考え込んでしまうのであった。 やがて、先生は、フォード自動車から、ブリジストンタイヤに転じて、一家の住いは大阪に移った。 その大阪支店で先生を待っていたものは、課長の椅子であった。 しかし、その椅子も、先生には坐り心地のいいものではなかった。 なるほど、セールスマンという肩書きはなくなり、埃をかぶって歩きまわる日々のかわりに、椅子に腰かけて判を捺す生活が主となったかも知れない。だが、そのどちらも先生には同じようにつまらなかった。 （自動車を売り込むことも、そのタイヤだけを売り込むことも、やはり雲助根性を必要とするのだ。これが俺の仕事だろうか。これを仕事としなければならないのだろうか） 先生は、社員たちが出て行った昼休みの事務室で、ほろ苦い思いを噛みしめた。 しかし、仕事はつまらないが、先生は自分というものを信じていた。いまに見ていろ。そういう気持ちがあった。 だから、家へ帰ると、先生は夫人に威張って言った。 「おれは日本一の婿殿だぞ」 新婚の翌年の正月であった。 先生夫妻は、婦人の実家へ年賀に行った。 綿布問屋であるから、そこには大勢の店員がいる。 夫人は、誘われるままに店員たちの仲間に入って歌留多をとった。 それを見て、先生は怒った。 「おれの女房なら、女房らしく、もっと威厳をもつんだ。雇人といっしょになって歌留多をとるなんて、なんという仕儀だ」 怒った先生は、そのままぷいと帰ってしまった。 その翌日、夫人は、こんなむずかしい良人と、今後どうやって行ったらいいだろうと真剣に悩んだ挙句、台所へ行って、飲めない酒をコップに一杯飲んだ。そうでもしなければやりきれなかった。 そして、ふらふらと外へ出た。 「まだおまえはお嬢さんのつもりでいるのか。何もおれが好き好んで貰ったのじゃないんだ。いやなら、いつでも出て行け」 さっき、そう怒鳴った先生も、婦人の姿が見えなくなると、さすがにあわてた。 すぐ、あとから追いかけて行った。 「おれは日本一の婿殿だぞ」という自慢は、決していいかげんのものではない。先生は真実そう自負していた。だから、家では威張っていた。 この大阪の家で、長男の誠八郎さんが生まれた。 五 しかし、誤解を受けないように、セールスマン時代の先生について、これだけは付け加えておきたい。先生は、負けることが嫌いであった。なにをしても一番にならなければ承知できないというタチであった。セールスマン時代といえども、この意地と気魄とで貫き通した。 後年、先生は、弟子たちに話した。 「よく切れる男というので、営業不振に陥っている支社を立て直すために転任させられたことがある。そこで私は、どうして品物が売れないのか、それを研究するために六カ月なにもしないで遊んでいた。少なくとも、第三者にはそう見えただろう。そのため、私は社内で大変な非難を受けた。しかし、その六カ月のあいだに、一つの発見をした。それは、どのセールスマンも、運転手との取引にかかりきりになっているので、うまく成績が上がらないということだ。それがわかった。そこで私は、運転手ではなく、自動車の持ち主と直接取引きすることにした。そのため、今まではゼロ、ゼロが続いていた売上げも、年末には同僚を追い越してしまった。このことが刺激となって、支社の営業成績は大変よくなった」 先生は、決して、自嘲の中にだけ生きていたのではなかったのである。 それどころか、やるだけは十分にやった上で、更に遠い一つの星――それがどういうものであるかは先生自身にもよくわからなかったが、とにかく遠くの空に光っている一つの星にあこがれ、それへの道を目指していたのであった。 六へ続く

――― 関 連 出 版 物 ――― 光は大地に 麻生 鋭 5 商 人 （一） 日の光は一日々々と濃くなって行った。部屋の前の桜も葉ざくらに変って、薄赤い葉の盛り上りのむこうにある空もギラギラして来た。 外出から帰って来て、私はなんの気なしに部屋の襖をあけた。 と、カーキー色のズボンから出ている大きな足が目についた。風来坊の山本だ。むこう向いて、腹ばいになって、何か読んでいるらしい。 山本は頭を回して私を見ると、 「読んだよ」とニヤニヤ笑うのであった。 そして、やおら起き上った。手にノートを持っている。私がメシヤ教の教祖の生い立ちから書き始めているそのノートである。 「油断もスキもありはしない。勝手に机の引出しなんかあけたりして……」 私は山本をにらみつけた。 「あはははは。そうムキになるなよ。君が岡田茂吉のことを書いてると言っていたから、多分この中だろうと思ってあけてみたんだよ。読んだって別に減るものじゃない。それに、なかなかよく書けてる」 そう言って、山本は又ニヤニヤ笑った。 「ごま化して、お世辞を言うなよ」と、私も笑ってしまった。 「教祖は、それからどうしたんだ？」 「それからとは？」 「血のめぐりの悪い男だな。自分で書いてるじゃないか、それ、父の死――」 「ああそうか。二十五歳以後の岡田茂吉を語れというのだね」 「そうよ。参考のために聞いておくんだ」 「くわしいことは、今調べている最中だから、よくわからない。しかし、多少の資料は集ってる」 「それで結構。粗筋さえわかれはいいんだ。何も信仰しようとは思ってないんだからな」と、山本は涼しい顔で煙草を吸っている。 「又そういう余計な憎まれ口をきく。君のヘソ曲りは死ぬまで直らないな、浄霊も効かないよ」と、私もやり返した。そして、話し出した―― 「二十五歳、父親に死に別れた教祖は、その父親が残しておいてくれた三千五百円の貯金を元手に、ささやかな小間物屋を開いた。小さな店先に、櫛、かんざし、スキ油や元結、てがらなどを並べて、母親と二人のひっそりとした生活をはじめた。かつては大画家を志した彼も、今は前垂れかけて、いらっしゃいまし、毎度有難うございますと、客を迎え、客を送り出す小商人になったのだ。しかし、からだの方は相変らず弱くて、往来を歩いていて、電車のはしる音を聞くと卒倒しそうになる。ひどい脳貧血に悩まされた」 「なるほど」と、山本がうなづいた。 私は続けた―― 「でも、岡田茂吉は、病気と格闘しつつ商売熱心に働いた。こんなことで参ってたまるものかと思った。岡田という男はタコだよ。風が強く吹いて来れば来るほど、ますます張り切って上って行く……そういう男なんや昔から」 （二） 「その意地張りのタコは、どのくらい青空に上ったんだ、商人として」と、山本はからだを乗り出した。 「商売は順調に進む。店はだんだん大きくなる。九尺間口の小店から出発したが、十年後には東京のまん中の京橋でも一流の卸問屋にセリ上ってしまったというのだからえらいものだ」 「全身これ闘志というところだな」と、山本も感心したように言った。 「そうだね。しかし、病気の方も却問屋なんだよ。チフスもやった。胃病も患った。腸カタルも起した。そればかりではない。リューマチス、尿道炎、痔、子供の頃からの頭痛もち。毎日四、五本の歯が順々に痛む。あんまり痛いので頭がヘンになる。いっそ自殺してしまおうとさえ思う。正に病気の大問屋だ」 「うーん、そいつはたまらねえな」と、病気などあまりしたことのない山本が、唸るように言うのであった。 「それでよく商売が出来たものさ。何しろその十年間で、三千五百円が十五万円になったというのだからね。大正七、八年の頃だ」 そう言いながら私は、三十五年前の十五万円は現在の何千万円に相当するだろうかと考えていた。 「じゃ、神様なんかにならないでも、商人としても相当なものになれたろうな」 「なれたろうじゃない。一段の発展を期して個人名義の店を会社組織にした。どうしても百万円の金が欲しかったのだ」 「金というやつは、たまればたまるほど欲しくなるものさ」 「ところが、その時岡田社長が百万円という金を欲しがったのはそういうことではない」 「権勢欲だろう？」 「ちがう。新聞社をつくろうという大望を抱いたのだ」 「新聞社だって？」と、山本が目を丸くした。 「うん。もう三十七、八歳になっていたが、金儲けだけではつまらなくなったのだ。新聞社をつくって世の中を毒する悪人ばらや偽善者どもをやっつけてやろうと考えたんだ。筆陣を張って、社会悪と闘おうというのだ。正義の十字軍を起そうというのだ」 「だが、その新聞社は出来なかったんだろう？」と、山本がきいた。 「その通りだ。大正十年春のパニックで、彼の夢も一挙に吹き飛ばされてしまった。会社はこういうように。ペシャンコだ」と、私は手で机を叩いて見せた。 「今のおれみたいなものだ。あの夢もこの夢も、みんなちりぢりというやつだ」と、山本は自分をあざけるようにうなづいた。 「なにを言ってるんだ。意気地なしの君じゃあるまいし、そんなことで涙ばかりポロポロ流しているような岡田茂吉ではない」 「じゃ、どうした」 「なにくそと、又立ち上った」 そう言って、私は山本の顔を見た。山本は何か考えているようであった。ちりぢりになってしまった昔の夢を思い出しているのかも知れない。 （三） 「なにくそと立ち上ったのも、新聞社をつくって社会悪と闘いたいという初一念からだが、この時の岡田茂吉は活字の鬼みたいになっていたのだな」と、私は茶をのみながら続けた。 「で、百万円は出来たか」と、山本が眼を光らせた。 「出来なかった。もう少しというところで、取引銀行が破産してしまったのだ。又々ペシャンコになった」と、私は再び手で机をたたいて見せた。 「いよいよ一巻の終りだな」 「ところが違う。茂吉は三たび立ち上った。」止ち上ったけれど、奥さんは妊娠五カ月の身で、とうとう死んでしまった」 「ひでえ人生苦だなあ」と、山本が泣きそうな顔をして言った。 「教祖が二十五歳で結婚してから十三年、苦労を共にして来た奥さんに死なれて、流石の彼も参ったろうと思うよ。その時、教祖は三十九歳だった」 「打ったり蹴ったりだ」 「うん。たいていの者なら、この辺で自殺するね。だが、岡田茂吉は更に決意を固めて、四たぴ奮い立った」 「猛牛のような男だな」と、山本がため息をつくように言った。 「ご名答。正に猛牛だよ。闘牛士から槍を打ち込まれた猛牛だ。血を流しながら突進した。そして、どうやら会社を建て直した」 「今度こそ成功だろう」 「と思ったのも束の間、大正十二年の関東大震災だ。ガラガラと来て、一夜のうちに全財産が灰になってしまったのだ」 山本は、ウームと唸った。そして、 「神は愛だなんて言う人間を見ると、おれはむしずが走る。神も結構残酷性をもっているんだ」と怒ったように言うのであった。 「だが、僕はそう思いたくないな。もしも岡田株式会社がパニックにも地震にも遭わなかったら、今日のメシヤ教はなかったろう。従って教祖もなかったろう。何も商人より宗教家の方がえらいとは言わないが、しかし、教祖を教祖にしたのは、君の言う神の残酷性だ。最愛の配偶者まで、腹の中の子供とともにさらって行く神の残酷性だ。だが、これが窮極においての残酷行為と言い切ってしまっていいものだろうか。愛などというとむしずが走るなら、神の情熱と言ってはおかしいかね？」 私がそう言うと、山本は大きな声で、 「どうして、そんなことが言えるんだ」と言った。 「偉大なる情熱は善悪の彼岸にあると言ったのは、例のニーチェだ。神にだって善悪を超える情熱があるだろうさ。商人岡田茂吉は、昭和二年の二月、すべての事業を無償で支配人に譲り、節分の日から宗教家としての第二の誕生をしたのだが、こういう重なる不幸がなかったら、あるいは信仰とは無縁の人間として終ったかも知れない」 そう答えながらも私は、自分の言葉に非情なものを感じ、心は滅入って行った。これが自分だったら、きっと神を呪うにちがいないと思った。 （四） 「それまでは無神論者だったのか？」と、山本がきいた。 「いや、三十二、三歳の頃から、漠とした信仰はもっていたらしい。しかし、すべてを投げ打って信仰一筋の生活に入ったのは、大正八年大本教団に加わってからだ。それまではまあ現実万能主義とでも言うかな、コチコチの人間さ。直観を重んじたベルグソンなどの哲学には相当共鳴したというが、理性を超えるものにはまだ本当に眼を向けていなかったと思う。それが百八十度の回転をしたのだ。これまでは、この世の品物を取次ぐ商人だったが、それが悩める大衆に慰めを配給する神の商人に変ったのだ」 私はこんなことを長々としゃべりながら、キリスト教徒迫害の先頭に立っていたパウロが、ある日、突然空からの光に打たれ、眼からうろこのようなものが落ちて、遂にキリスト教宣教の勇者となったという話を思い出していた。 二人とも、黙っていた。 山本は冷えた茶をのんでいた。 “回心。それは突如としてやって来るかも知れない。あるいは徐々にやって来るかも知れない。どっちにしてもコペルニクス的転回にはちがいない。昨日の茂吉はもう今日の茂吉ではなくなり、今日の茂吉はもう昨日の茂吉ではなくなっている――。なんという奇術が行われるものだろうか。神の奇術の種明しは誰にも出来ない” そんなことを考えていると、山本が、急に、 「でも、ヘンだぞ。大本教は観音様とは関係がないはずだ」と言った。 「なかなかいいところを突いて来たな。たしかに大本教の中には観音のカの字もない。あれは明治二十五年の元日、教祖の出口直子が五十五歳の時だ。初めて国常立尊という神様が憑って、ペラペラといろいろのことをしゃべった――と言うより、そのことを自分で書いて行った。いわゆるお筆先といわれるもので、大本教はこれを唯一の聖典としてスタートした。だから神道だ。神道だから観音様は登場して来ない。もっともメシヤ教では、観音は本来神位にあるので、衆生済度のために観世音という菩薩の地位に降りて、融通無碍の働きをしていられるが、やがて地上に楽土が出来れば、又元の神格に還るのだ、というような見方をしているが……」 山本は、私の茶わんに茶をついで差し出しながら、 「長広舌でのどが乾いたろう。一杯飲め。それにしても、君はなんでもよく知ってるな」とからかうような眼をした。 「なあに、必要があるから、ゆうべ初めて読んでみたのさ、大本教のパンフレットをね」と私は頭を茶いて見せた。 「ゆうべ読んだにしても、それだけ頭に残っていればたいしたものだ。おれなんか、前の晩一緒に酒飲んだ女給の顔だって覚えちゃいられねえ。薄情なものよ」 「それそれ、又君はそういうふうなことを言う。わざと自分を道化師に仕立てて喜んでるんだろうが、あまりいい図じゃない。みっともないぞ」 （五） 道化師という言葉は、やっばり風来坊の山本にも不快だと見えて、ちょっと額にシワを寄せた。 で、私はあわてて、 「だからメシヤ教が御神体として祀っている観音様は、教祖が大本教から引継いだものではないんだ」と静かに言った。 「じゃ、岡田茂吉の発明か」と山本は機嫌を直してきいた。 「あはははは。発明とは面白いことを言うな。このことについては教祖自身が書いている。こんな意味だったよ。――私が観音を信仰して今日のようになったのではない。全く観音の方で私を道具に使ったのだ。観音という主人が思い通りに下男の私を使うので、私としては全然自由がない。と言って、普通に言うところの不自由でもない。観音の揮う妙智力は自由無碍だから、私の不自由は同時に大自由なのだ。そう書いている」 「そんなこと、書かない方がいいんだ。教祖ともあろう者は、なるべく物事を神秘的にしておかないと有難味が出ない」 「ところが、岡田という変った教祖は、自分の心境をどしどし赤裸々に発表してしまうのだ。そうしないと気持がわるいと言うのだよ。いいところがある」 「で、大本教へ入って？」と、山本が先を促した。 「うん。今も言ったように、大正八年に入信したんだが、それから四、五年は空白の時期が続いた。神の商人も、まだ新米という時代だったのだな。それから大正十三年、再び熱心な信仰を取り戻したわけだが、こんどは本物だ。明けても暮れても神と人との交流について研究した。火の玉のようになった。出口王仁三郎から深い信頼を得て、幹部になった」 「どうしてその大本教をおん出たんだ？」と、山本はどうもよくわからないという表情をした。 「いや、出口王仁三郎は、確かに傑出した人物だろうが、惜しいかな教団統卒の才に欠けるところがあったと思う。一宗の総帥として多くの信者を引張って行くという手腕に乏しかった。だから発展にまかせて、内部は乱れて来た。岡田茂吉は、大本教の裏側を見つめて、もうこの教えから得るものは何もなくなったと思い、あっさりと身を引いた。信じ込む方でも熱情家だが、もうなんの学びとるところもないと思うとキッパリ見限る方でも熱情家なのだよ。正直だから、魅力のなくなった教団で、幹部づらして閑日月を楽しむなんて芸当は出来ないのだな」 「ということは、油断をするとメシヤ教にだって当てはまる」と山本が言った。 「そうだ。だが、そういうことは教祖自身がハッキリ言っているよ。――開祖の教えを金科玉条として堅持しているうちに、いつか時代と離れてしまうことがある。こいつは危険だとね。だから教祖は、進歩的宗教という言葉を使っている」と、私は説明した。 「えらいよ、岡田茂吉は」と、山本が静かに言った。 「死の商人じゃなくて、詩の商人なんだ。夢もたっぷりある」と私は答えた。 （六） 「それからどうした」と、しばらくして山本がきいた。 「昭和九年だったかな。岡田茂吉は麹町平河町に小さな家を借りて、応神堂という看板をかけた。さあ、なんて言ったらいいかな。民間療法にはちがいないが、いわゆる物理的指圧療法じゃない。霊の世界の力を導入しての掌療法だ。だから信仰的療法といっていいだろう」と、私は慎重に答えた。すると山本は困った顔をして、 「霊的治療などと言われても、おれにはわからない」と言うのであった。 「霊、即ちソウルだ。精神（スピリット）とは違う。からだの病気はすべて霊魂のうめきだと思えばわかるだろう」 「なるほど、霊魂のうめきか。昔読んだ聖書の中にも、神みずから嘆き給うという文句があったっけ。こいつはおれの好きな文句だったよ」と、山本が遠いものを思い出すような眼付をした。 「あれはロマ書の中の最も劇的な言葉だ。造られたものはすべて虚無に渡される運命にあるが、そういう造物主みずから嘆いているというのだ」 「やんなっちゃうなあ」と、山本は溜息をついた。 「その溜息が尊いよ。君もクリスチャンになれる」と、私は真面目に言った。 「いやなこった。いくらおだてても、今更アーメンになんかならないよ」と、山本は仰向けに倒れて、頭の下へ両手をやった。そして、 「ところで、応神堂が観音教団になったのはいつからなんだ」ときいた。 「君も案外お光様のことは知っているじゃないか。観音教団だなんて」と、私は笑って言った。 「新聞ぐらい読んでいるよ。あんまり軽蔑するな」と、山本も笑って答えた。 「ある日、ここに妙なことが起ったんだ。――昭和九年の十月、東屋という男がひょっこり応神堂へ訪ねて来たと思い給え。その男は、自分は二十年前に支那大陸を歩き回っていた時、神がかりになったことがある。そして、その時、今から二十年後に日本に観音力を持った人が出るという御託宣を聞いたと言うのだ。それから日本へ帰って来て、どうかしてその人を探し出したいと考えていたそうだが、所も名もわからないのだから雲をつかむような話だ。ところが、たまたま麹町に知り合いがあって、その話をしたところ、それなら平河町にいる岡田という人だろう、観音様で病気を治しているという評判だと、こういう話なのだ。そこで早速訪ねて来たという」 「それで？」 「いろいろ話し合った後、その東屋という男が、教祖を床の間の前に坐らせて写真をとって帰ったそうだ。翌日、東屋はそれを現像して持って来たが、乾板の左下から右上へかけて白い煙のようなものが濛々と湧き上っている。そして、その中に千手観音の姿がハッキリと現われていたというわけだ。妙なこととは、このことなんだよ」 （七） 「あほははは。そんなバカなことがあるものか。そいつはトリック写真だよ」と、びっくりするような声で山本が笑い出した。 「誰も一応はそう考える。僕もついこの間までは、そう考えていた。だが、現在僕は、この話を信用しようと思っている」と、私は静かに言った。 「なぜだ」 「わかっているものなら、何も信ずる必要はない。わからないからこそ信ずるのだ。信ずる心に説明はいらない」 「君は善意の人間だよ」と、山本は半ば皮肉のように言って、起き上った。 「善意と悪意と、この二つのどっちかに生命を賭けなければならないとしたら、君もきっと善意の方に全生命を賭けるだろうさ」と私は言った。 「どうして？」 「善意に賭けて、その善意が勝てば、生命が得られるが、たとえ負けたって損はない。善意を信じて、明るい場所で生きて来ただけ儲けものだ。ところが、その反対に、悪意に賭けて見給え。勝って悪意の世に生きていたって少しも楽しくはないし、負ければ生命はなくする、世界は暗いで、こんなつまらないことはないじゃないか」 「よし、わかった。では、その妙な話を君が信じようとしていることは君の自由ということにしておこう。だが、それから応神堂主人はどうしたんだ？」 「教祖は、これを見て、観音の慈悲の手が自分をしっかり支えていてくれることを知った。観世音菩薩が、一分時も離れずに自分を護っていてくれていることを確実に知った。この自覚から、大日本観音会をつくった。昭和ももう十年になって、満洲事変のあと、日華事変への危険な空気が刻々と濃くなって行く頃のことだ」 「じゃ、その後ば順風に帆を張ってというわけだね、多少の弾圧はあっても……」と、山本がきいた。 「いやいや。それどころじゃない。神の商人となった岡田という人間を抹殺しようと、妨害者は手をかえ品をかえて、彼の身辺を狙った。宗門の開祖ともなれば、それが当然の運命かも知れないがね。イエスにはユダやパリサイの徒がいたし、釈尊には提婆がいた。この提婆というやつは、釈尊を殺そうとして、崖の上から石を落したり、酔った象をけしかけたりしたというから念仏入ったものさ」 「日蓮の法難なら、おれも知ってるよ」と、山本がいばって見せた。 「天理教の中山ミキも、たしか五、六回は入獄している。ブタ箱などは二十度以上入っている」と、私もいばって見せた。 「メシヤ教でも、そういう弾圧はあったのか？」 「教祖はたしか四回、留置場へ入れられた。書いた本もたぴたび発禁になっている。先駆者の悲劇だよ。君はさっき順風に帆を張ってと言ったが、岡田茂吉に限り、逆風に帆を張ったと言った方がいい。それで現在の安全な港まで行き着いたのだから凄いよ」 （八） 「さて、おれももう帰ろう。屋根裏部屋という安全港へね」 そんなことを言って、山本は帰って行った。 山本が帰ったあとも、私は昭和十一年の夏、教祖が埼玉県大宮の警察署から呼び出された事件を思い出していた。 その頃、岡田茂吉は東京こう外の玉川上野毛に住んでいたが、弟子が医師法違反をしたという。 「大宮の片倉製糸工場で、おまえの弟子の武井という男が、何十人もの女工に指圧療法をやっているが、それは明らかに医師法に触れる」と、署の司法主任は、岡田茂吉を威嚇した。 教祖は、頭を垂れて、黙っていた。霊の存在を認めない者に何を言ってもムダだと思って、黙って、留置されている武井のことを考えていた。 司法主任は、ジリジリして、 「それに、その妙な写真など飾って、あんなインチキ写真で人を釣ろうなどとは怪しからんぞ」とののしって来た。 教祖は、なおも沈黙をまもっていた。武井はどうしているだろう、可哀そうなことをした、と思っていた。 すると倒に立っていた一人の刑事が、やにわに教祖の髪の毛をつかんでグイグイと引っ張りながら、 「これが生神様とは聞いてあきれる」と言った。 それを見ると、もう一人の刑事は、これも竹刀を振り上げて、 「貴様のような悪鬼は、ぶっ叩かなければ目が覚めないだろう」と迫って来た。 「やられるか？」と、教祖は観念の目をつぶった。 その時だった。刑事の一人が、 「あ、痛い」と、自分の頭を抱えた。 するともう一人の刑事も、 「おれも腹が痛くなって来やがった」と言った。 そして、二人とも妙な顔をして部屋を出て行った。 その間に司法主任は調書をまとめ、これに印を押せと教祖の前に突き出した。 読んで見ると、「観音の写真はトリック写真です。あんなもので信者をごま化したのは、まことに済みません」というようなことが書いてあった。教祖は、こっちで何も言わないのに既に出来上ってしまっている調書というものの早業に感心しながら、生まれながらの盲に色の説明をするようなものだと思って、黙って印を押した。 押す時に、涙がにじんだ。 その夜、留置場の寝床の中で、教祖はこんなことを考えていた。 「もしもあの写真が二重露出のトリック写真ならば、それを御生大事に飾っているこの岡田は、天下の大馬鹿かも知れない。だが、二重露出であるかどうかは、どんな写真の大家が見てもわからないのだ。私は、私を信ずる。私の信用する多くの人が、私の側に観音の姿が見えることがあると言ってくれる以上、私はあの不思議な写真を信ずる。将来信仰に関する著書を出す時が来たら、私はあの写真を堂々と巻頭に掲げよう」 （九） 私は、続いて、教祖が二度目に警察署に呼ばれた時のことを思い出した。 岡田茂吉が大宮署から戻って来て、やれやれと思う間もなく、彼は再び玉川署に呼び出された。 今度はなんだろうと思って出かけて行くと、「指圧療法は医師法違反と見るから、今後は営業を禁止する」と言い渡された。 「それでは暮らして行けなくなります」と言うと、 「それでは、おまえのやっている指圧療法の中から宗教的な意味を抜いて、単なる民間療法屋としてやるなら許可するが、どうだ」と詰め寄って来た。 アンマ、と同じ民間療法屋！ 岡田茂吉は、またまたただの商人に戻らなければならないのか。 「そう致します」 教祖は、そう答えて、うつむいた。やっぱり涙がにじんだ。 この時は、十一日間も留置された。 ところが、それから四年、太平洋戦争への雲行きが怪しくなって来た頃、岡田茂吉はまた玉川署から出頭命令を受けた。 行ってみると、また留置。医師法違反だと、まだ言っている。 「もう金輪際、指圧療法などやりませんという誓約書を書け」 「ああ、そうですか。病気を治してはいけないとおっしゃるならば、医師法というもの自体を疑いたくなりますが、今はもう何も申しません。どんな病人が来て、治して下さいと頼まれても、警察でいけないと言われてますからと断わればいいのでしょうから……」 教祖は、落ちついて、そう言った。もう涙など出なかった。その顔には薄笑いさえ浮かべていた。 司法主任は、ピリピリして、 「書けばいいんだ。つべこべ言わずに、ただ書けばいいんだ」と眼を光らせて言った。 三日目に、放免された。 ――私の思い出のフィルムは、ここで切れた。 帰って行った山本が、又戻って来て、襖のむこうから一枚の葉書を投げてよこした。 「どうしたんだ？」ときくと、 「さっき郵便箱に入っていたから取って来てやったんだが、ポケットに入れたまま帰るまで忘れていた。思い出して、こいつはいけねえと思ったから、戻って来たんだよ」と言って、ニヤニヤ笑っている。 葉書を手に取って見ると、差出人は沼津の南チエだった。 山本は、それをのぞき込むようにして、 「お安くないぞ」などと言いながら、飄然と出て行った。 葉書には、 「先日は失礼致しました。その後の私の心境、いろいろと聞いて頂きたく、今度の日曜日の午後御訪ね致したいと思いますが、御都合はいかがでしょうか」という意味の事が記してあった。 私は、わざわざチエが来るというなら、丸子へ連れて行って、名物のとろろ汁でも食べさせてやろうと考えた。 それで、 「来るなら午前中に来なさい」と返事を書いた。 （十） その晩、私は毎日寝る前に書いている日記帳に、こんなことを書きつけた。 地上のイエスを、天上のキリストにしたものは、残酷な言い方だが、ユダではなかったろうか。銀三十枚で師を売ったユダ――彼は天罰を蒙って、裂けた腹から腸を露出させて死んだが、しかしユダの裏切りがなかったら、イエスはついに人間イエスで終っただろう。イエスというナザレ生まれの男を神の座に据えたのは、ユダが裏切って、彼を十字架にかけたからだ。十字架がなくては、復活はない。復活がなくては、昇天もないだろう。 修行中の釈迦を悩ましたものに、例の提婆がある。宣教の邪魔をしただけではない。釈迦の命を奪おうとした。しかし、こういう、言わば敵があったればこそ、悉達太子は仏陀になれた。菩提樹の下の六年間の冥想だけが、この人間を仏法の象徴的存在とならしめた、と考えるのは浅はかだと思う。 神の慈悲のうちには、われわれが災難と思うものも包含されている。破産、また破産。借金の重圧が来る。病気の苦悩が来る。遂には妻の死。一文なしの孤独地獄。 岡田茂吉の前半生は、嵐の中の古障子のようにビリビリに破れ去った。 だが、これを災難と思わず、自分を観音のあやつり人形だと自覚するまでの舞台装置だと考えなければならないだろう。なぜならば、長い苦しい人生の果てにおいて、無神論者は回心したのだから。これらの物心を両面の痛みがなかったなら、岡田茂吉、この世の品物だけを卸す商人として、せいぜい紳商と呼ばれて終ったろう。 教祖自身も、こう書いている。 「本教の出生は、私が企画したものでは全然ない。全く観世音菩薩が時期到来によって、因縁ある私の肉体を行使され始めたのである。だから実は、菩薩自ら開教されたものである。 だが、これはどうしたことだろうか。 私は観音信仰は全くもっていなかったのである。ただ、観音はいかにも眉目秀麗で、容姿円満。何宗にも祀られているが、その偏頗（へんぱ）のない菩薩ぶりに好感をもっていたまでのことである。 それが、大本教に入信してからしばらくたってからのことだが、私を見る人々が、先生が今便所へお立ちになる時観音様が後からついて行かれた――というようなことをしきりに言うので、私は自分は観世音菩薩に何か因縁があるにちがいないと思うようになった。そして、それ以来いろいろと不思議なことが起った」…… もしもそうならば、その観音様がこの男を自分に近づけようとして、手をかえ品をかえて種々のこころみに遭わせた。その惨苦こそ、実は慈悲であったというべきではなかろうか。警察の圧力すら、形を変えたユダや提婆――換言すれば、神仏の大愛が加えた鞭と言ってはいけないだろうか。 「エホバよ。なんじの鞭、われを慰さむ」 私はふと、旧約のダビデの歌を思い浮かべた。

―― 岡田自観師の論文集 ―― 御教え検索 ： help 資料検索 ： 伝道の手引き Ⅰ －１－１ 信仰の基本 第一章 明主様の御教えについて １ 明主様の御言葉は即ち神の言葉 〔 御講話（S27年4月7日） 『御教え集』9号、昭和27(1952)年5月15日発行〕 『それからこういうことを知らなければならないんですがね。それは、昔から宗教の教祖とかいう人が、なんでも一々神様にお伺いするんですね。そうすると御託宣が出て、神様がこうおっしゃった、とか言うんですがね。そうすると、それを聞いた人はたいへんありがたがるんです。ありがたく思うんですね。ところが私はそんなことはしないですね。ただ、その場その場で簡単に言ってのけるので、有難味がないんですね。だから、ともすればそれを軽く思って聞き逃しちゃうわけですね。で、なにかあると、こういうことを以前にお聞きした。これだということに気がつくんですが、初めはなかなかそう思わないんです。それですから私の言う通りやらない人も随分あるんですよ。それはどういうわけだと言うと、私は神様に聞く必要はないんです。私のお腹におられる神様は最高の神様です。自分が言うことやることが、そのまま神様がやっていることと同じですからね。つまり直接なのですね。ところが、今までの宗教の教祖というのは間接なんです。キリストにしろ、自分はエホバの命によって生まれたとか、天の父だとか、なんとか言いますが、あれはやっぱり間接的なんです。で、私におられる神様は、エホバと同じなんですからね。そこで、私は神様を拝んだことがないですね。どこのどの宗教でも、お祭りだなんていうと、やっぱり神様に、教祖が恭しく礼拝するものなんですがね。私はやらないんです。というのは、私が拝む神様はないんですよ。もし神様があるとすれば、私よりみんな下だからね。だから、神様の方で私を拝んで良いんですよ。それですから、御守りを一つ書くにも、ふつうは斎戒沐浴して、羽織袴で恭しく書くんですが、私は夏なんか裸でアグラかいて書く。だから知らない人は有難味はないんですがね。私はなんでも無造作にやってのけるんです。難しくする必要がないからですよ。ですから、かえってその点を逆に考えられるんですね。逆に思われるんですね。誤解されるんですね。しかしそれは、だんだん分かってくれば良いと思っている。だから一時的誤解は私はなんとも思わないですがね。こういうこともあまり生神様らしく思わせることになるので、私は好かないのであまり言わなかったんですが、そのために私の言うことを軽くみる場合がよくあって、そのために間違いがよくありますから、そのために言っておいた方が良いと思ってお話しするんです。だから、その点を良く心得ていて、他の宗教や、教祖と較べればはっきり分かるんですよ。一番分かるのは、キリストの奇蹟なんかは、非常に有名になってますが、私の弟子で、キリストと同じような奇蹟はさかんにやっているんですからね。それ以上の奇蹟さえあるんです。時間があったら読もうと思ったんですがね。奇蹟以上の奇蹟というんですがね。今度新聞に出しますが、読むのは時間がないから略しますが、百姓夫婦で、最初田んぼに入って、電線が切れて落ちたのを、うっかりつかんだんです。六十ボルトで――感電してひっくり返って倒れたんです。それを見て、亭主が、これはたいへんだと入ってつかんだところが、またひっくり返ったんです。電気の方では、水に入ると五倍の電流が流れると言うんですね。ですから、その電流を食って、身体が仮死状態になった。ところが良いあんばいに助かったと、本人が書いたものなのです。これは、ぜんせん学理で理屈のつけようがないんです。精しく書いてありますが、新聞に出てみれば解ります。（次号に掲載） それから原子爆弾のお蔭詰も、そういったので七つばかり集まりました。これも、新聞に出しますがね。これなんかも、随分奇蹟がありました。ほとんど、信者で――御守りを受けたのは、一人も被害がなかったんですからね。だから原子爆弾も恐るるに足らずですよ。必ず助かります。また、原子爆弾で半分死んだような人でもなんでもない。やっぱり浄霊で治っちゃうんですからね。だから、この奇蹟なんていうのは、キリストでも――あの時分には電気やなにかなかったからしかたがないが、それはキリストの奇蹟以上ですよ。今話した、キリストやなんかも間接的の力であって、私は直接だということは、これだけを見ても証拠づけられるんです。時間が来ましたから寸鉄を。』 ２ 明主様の御言葉は厳格に守るべき事 〔 御講話（S27年8月6日） 『御教え集』13号、昭和27(1952)年9月25日発行〕 『ところで、私の話を間違える人が非常にある。私は随分はっきり言うのですが、昨日も一週間に一回と言ったら、今日は二回という人がある。一週間に一回と二回では倍違います。頭について、信者さんの頭が――信者さんの頭ばかりでなく、世間の人は信者さん以下ですが、信者さんでも非常に頭が悪いのです。というのは、私の言う通りに考えないのです。明主様はこうおっしゃったが、あれはこういう意味なんだ。こういう意味というのを自分で作ってしまうのです。それで間違うことがよくある。それでまた私の言った通りをやるということは、自分が値打ちがなかったり頭が悪かったりするように思うのです。ですから私の言った通りにやる人が少ないのです。私はいつも言うのですが、私が思う通り言った通りにする人は英雄と言うのです。偉いです。ところが一般は必ず違います。これは信仰ばかりでなく、庭の方でもそうです。私の言う通りにやる職人というのは一人もないです。これをここにやれと言うと、必ずここにやる人はないです。こっちにやるとか、あっちにやる。私がこっちにやれと言うとあっちにやる。だから職人には手を焼いているのです。ところが私の言う通りやるのが一番易しいのです。その易しいことを嫌うのですから不思議です。植木屋で一人こういうのがあったのです。この石を一尺こっちにやれと言うと、一尺やれない。二、三寸しかいかない。それで私が、どうして一尺やらない。こっちにやれと言うと、今度は五、六寸やった。 それから、駄目だもう一度やれと言った。すると今度は斜めにやった。斜めにしては駄目なのです。これで三度駄目なのだから、四度目に違ったらその職人は断るからと言った。言う通りにやれそうだが、その通りにやらない。なぜかと言うと、自分は手を引いて親方に頼むと言うのです。親方にこうやってくれと言ってやったら二、三時間でできました。ところが先にやった人は三、四日かかりました。そういうことがあるのです。特に日本人はどうも言う通りにやらない、言う通りに考えない、という一種のくせみたいな、病気みたいなものだと思う。だから私がいつも話しすることがよく違ってしまうのです。だから明主様がこうおっしゃったのでこうやったが、どうもうまくいかない。そういうはずはないと、良く聞いてみると違う。今の病気のこともその通りです。私は決して駈引や嘘はないのです。それは、よく昔からの偉い人でも、いろいろ――なんと言いますか、ありのままでなく、いくらか形容したり、いろいろそういうきらいがありますが、私はそれが嫌いで、なんでもありのまま率直に言いますから、その通りにやれば必ずうまくいきます。』 ３ 明主様の御教えは何事でも素直に守るべき事 〔 御講話（S29年1月17日） 『御教え集』30号、昭和29(1954)年2月15日発行〕 『前にも言ったとおり、箱根は霊的で熱海は体的ですから、熱海の地上天国ができれば、要するに体的に発展するわけです。だから本当に目立つわけです。いよいよおもしろい張り合いのある時期に入ってきたわけです。だからして神様の方はチャンと準備や、芝居ならプログラムができているわけです。そのとおりに、少しも違わないでチャンとゆくのです。ただ時期だけのものです。大本教のお筆先に「時節ほど有難い、恐ろしいものはないぞよ」「この事が分り出したら、世界は唸るぞよ」というのがありますが、もうそこの直前に来たわけです。それから「こんなものがあんなものになり、あんなものがこんなものになる仕組であるぞよ」というのがありますが、お筆先というのは実に簡単な言葉で、すばらしい大きなことを言い尽くしてあります。私などもその当時は本当には分からなかったのですが、神様というものは、なんだか変な言い方だと思ってましたが、今になってみると、それがピッタリと当たっているのです。「何事も神の言うとおりに致せば間違いはないぞよ」というのがあるのです。自然農法にしても、私の言うとおりにした人は、チャンと予定どおりに進んでゆくのです。効果もあるのです。ところが農民は長い間の習慣でなかなか言うことをきかないのです。なにしろ今もって有肥をやっている人がそうとうあるのですから……。ようやく今年あたりから気がついて、“では切り替えよう”ということになった人が随分あるようです。それについてこういう話があります。大本教の教祖様が神様から“直よ、お前はこれから外国に行くんだよ。直ぐ外国に行きなさい”と言うので、教祖様は“私にはそんな金も何もないのに外国に行けないでしょう”と言うと、 “なにいいんだよ、五円持って行けばいいんだよ”というので、教祖様は五円札を持ってノコノコ出掛けたのです。そうすると途中まで行くと“直や、もう行かんでもよいぞよ”と言うので、“神様はどうして御からかいになるのです”と聞くと、“いや、お前がどのくらいワシの言うことをきくか試してみたのだ。だから、もうこれで分かったからいいんだよ”というわけで、神様が試されたわけです。そのくらいに素直に言うことを聞くということです。お筆先に「何事も神の申す事に間違いはないから、素直が一等であるぞよ」とありますが、そういうようで、いつも言うとおり、私がなんでもなく言ったことでも大変意味があることですから、そのとおりにやれば決して間違いはないのです。今度の無肥料栽培も、最初はテンデ耳に入らなかったです。それこそ“明主様は病気を治すことはなるほど確かに大丈夫ですが、農業のことはそれほどのことがあるわけがない”と思ったらしいのですが、これは時節のことだから、いくら言っても分かるわけがないので、しようがないのですが、そういうようで、ようやく思うとおりの実績が上がってきたわけで、非常に結構です。』 附1 御言葉には素直に「ハイ」と従うべき事 〔 御垂示（S26年5月1日） 『御垂示録』6号、昭和27(1952)年1月25日発行〕 「鎮魂のお授けは願えませんでしょうか」 『 いけないよ。』 「いかなる場合においても、いけないのでございましょうか」 『鎮魂はいけないと言ったら「はい」と言えばいい。助けてもらいたい。よし助けてやろう。と言うあれで、本当はいけない――神様になるからね。神様のお取り次ぎをさせていただくと言うのでなければね。』 附2 御教えを正確に守らず御注意戴いた例 〔 御垂示（S27年3月1日） 『御垂示録』8号、昭和27(1952)年4月25日発行〕 「十年ほど前より神経麻痺の方で、御浄霊でたいへん楽にはさせていただきました。龍の墨絵の軸がございますが、先日お伺させていただきまして、関係があるかも知れないので、御神前に置くようにと御教えいただいておりましたので、それをお伝えしましたが一週間ほどで、気にすることもないと箱にしまったそうでございます。先日見てくれと申しますので、見ましたところ、妖気を受けるようで、まだまだ御言葉通りにしたほうが良いと言い、祝詞を奏上いたしますと、風もないのに御神体だけが五寸から七寸くらい離れまして、非常に揺れまして、十五分くらい続きました」 『最初、龍神は光明如来様の前に置けと言ったでしょう。そうですね。それから一週間経ってから箱に入れたんですか。それがたいへんな間違いです。それは、あなたがその人にお詫びさせなければならない。私の言うことを――私が一週間だけで良いと言ったのなら良いが、私はそうは言わないでしょう。ただ置いておけと言ったでしょう。そうしたら、半年なら半年、一年なら一年経ってから、私に聞くのが本当でしょう。それを、あなたが聞かないというのは間違っている。それを気がついて言うのが本当です。私が、こう言ったのを、勝手に人間のほうでやると、お咎（とが）めがありますよ。ですから、御神前に置けと言った以上、置いておけば良い。それで、そむいたことを本人に良く言って、光明如来様にお詫びするように言うことがあなたの務めです。当分ですが、巻くときは私に聞いて巻くのが本当です。』 「巻いたままでよろしゅうございましょうか」 『巻いたままで良いです。何か台をしてね。』 ４ 神様の厳格さについて 〔 御講話（S28年3月7日） 『御教え集』20号、昭和28(1953)年4月15日発行〕 （御論文「一、 奇蹟とは何ぞや 」「二、 霊主体従 」「三、 霊と体 」） 『この終わりのところが肝腎なのです。今までの宗教……というが教えですが、教えだけでは力が弱いのです。ところが救世教は教えとともに事実を見せるというので、これで人間は初めて神様は確かに在るということが分かり、そうすると悪いことはできないということになって、これで本当の人間になるわけです。それで神様は確かに在るということを見せるのは奇蹟なのです。奇蹟以外で神様の実在を信ずるということはできないのです。ところが今まではそういった奇蹟を見せないで、ただ「神は在る、在るから信じろ」と言うが、実際理屈に合いません。そこで、本当に救われないのです。 このことでおもしろい話があります。昨日聞いた話で、今度の大祭の余興にアザブさんが灰田勝彦を頼みに行ったのです。そうすると馬鹿に高いことを言うのだそうです。それで「随分高いではないか」と言うと、支配人が「救世教なんて泥坊みたいなことをして金を取っているのだから」と言ったのです。ところがその人がそれから三、四日たって死んでしまったのです。』 御伺い 明主様申し上げます。京都と大阪の間を自動車で走っている時に、ちょうど雪が降っておりまして、その時京阪国道から下に辷（すべ）り落ちて死んでおります。 『自動車で死んだそうですが、これははっきりした事実です。前にもこういうことがありました。私がまだ東京の宝山荘にいた時日蓮宗の学者で、名前は忘れましたが、誰でも知っているくらい有名な人です。その人が私の書いた『明日の医術』の本を見て、なんでも非常に悪いことを言ったのです。「こんなことを書いて人を瞞すとはインチキもはなはだしい」というようなことです。もっと酷いことを言ったのですが、私は忘れました。それでちょうど一年ほどたってから、街路で轢死したのです。それも、最初は自動車にどこかぶつかって電車道に倒れて、ハッと思った時に電車が来て顔を轢いたのです。ですから顔がめちゃめちゃになったのです。その時に中島さんが「とうとう罰があたった」と話しに来ましたが、そういうことがありました。そういうことはまだありますが、この神様は非常に厳密な神様なのです。いろいろおもしろい話がありますが、時間がないからあんまり詳しくは話せません。なおまた大本教の教祖が最初の修行していた時にそういうことがありました。大阪に算盤占いというのがありましたが、そこに行って占うと、「出口直さん、あなたに懸っている神様は本当の神様ではなく、悪魔だから気をつけなければならない」と言うので、教祖さんはびっくりしたのです。たいへんな神様だと思っていたが、悪魔だということなので、帰ってから神様に伺ったのです。そうすると、その神様は国常立尊ですが、「直や、一週間たったらもう一度占ってもらえ」と言うので、一週間たってから行ってみるといないので、聞いてみると「死んだ」というのです。それは、たいへんに立派な神様を悪魔と言うのですから、これは許せないのです。今言う「救世教は泥坊みたいなことをして金を取っている」と言ったそれ以上のものでしょう。それでこの国常立尊という神様は実に厳格で、悪いことは絶対に許さないという神様ですが、そういうようなことがありました。まだいろいろなことがありますが、時間がないからこれだけにしておきます。』 ５ 明主様の御言葉を不正確に伝えたので混乱を生じた例 〔 御講話（S27年8月27日） 『御教え集』13号、昭和27(1952)年9月25日発行〕 『私は以前リンゴを食べなかったから、信者のある人が――その時分は大先生と言ったが――「大先生はどうしてリンゴはおあがりになりませんか」と言うから、私は「リンゴはつゆ気がないから、あんまり好かないから食べない。だから食べたい人は食べても良いが、私は食べない」と、よくリンゴを持ってきますから、ちょっと言っておいた。それからこういうことを言った。「よく医学の方ではリンゴは薬になると言うが、別にどの果物が薬になるということはないので、神様は必要があってこしらえたのだから、それの好きな人は食べて良いので、リンゴが薬になるということはないから」と言ったことがあるのです。そうするとどう間違えたものか「明主様はリンゴはいけないと言った」ということになって、それはかなり拡まったものです。私はその都度取り消しましたが、かなり伝播力が強かったとみえて、取り消しの方が効果がないのです。そのあげく最近おもしろいことを聞いたのです。これは地方でですが、リンゴは医学では薬になるというのだから、リンゴを食べるとやっぱり薬毒が害をするから、そこの家では、リンゴをもらっても食べないで腐らせるというのです。なんだというと薬毒が怖いというのです。そういう滑稽なことがあるのです。だから私が言ったことや書いてあることを、そのまま受け取ると良いのですが、それにおまけをつけてだんだん誇張して、口から口へ伝わるために、だんだん育っていって、とんでもないことになってしまうのです。だからそういう馬鹿馬鹿しいようなことで、あんがい間違ったことがありますから、すべてなんでもいつも言う常識です。神様は人間においしい味のある物は、これは食べろ、味というものが栄養になるのだから、味のない苦い物とかまずい物は食べてはいけない。そういうためにあるのだから、それを我慢して食べるのは間違っている。ということは本にも書いてありますから、それをそのままとるようにすれば、間違いないのです。だからつまり自然ということを忘れないことと、常識で判断することを守っていれば、まず間違いないということです。』 ６ 明主様の御教えの「裏」などと言うものはない事 〔 御講話（S27年6月6日） 『御教え集』11号、昭和27(1952)年7月15日発行〕 『それからこういうことを時々聞くんですがね。私の本やなにかで裏表があると言うんですね。そういうことを聞くんですがね。一時そういうことの、随分はなはだしいことがあったです。裏表があるように見る人は邪神が憑っている。なぜというのは、今までのお経にしろ、あらゆるものは夜のものだから、どうしても確かに裏表があったんです。夜の世界だったら、ここだけは月が照らすから見えるが、ここは見えない。ところが昼の世界ではここも見えるが、ここも見えるんです。だから裏表はないんですね。だから私の説いたものは、そんなことはないんです。そのまま信ずれば良いですね。それから今までのことは根本が悪になっていたから、明からさまに言うことができないんです。そこで秘密があったんですね。あらゆるものがそうだったんですね。これは宗教も無論そうでしたね。なにしろうっかりすればキリストみたいや、日本のいろんな偉い坊さんでも島流しになったり、殺されようとしたりしたから、どうしても明からさまにできない。秘密にしたんですね。われわれだってそうですよ。終戦前はそうですよ。はっきり言えなかった。だから「明日（みょうにち）の医術」でも暖昧極まるものがあったですが、あれははっきり書けなかったんです。ところが今はそうではない。言論の自由ではっきり書けるから、今度の「結核信仰療法」ははっきり書いた。日本がそういう民主的になったということは、昼間の明るい時期に一歩近づいたわけですね。そういうわけですから、メシヤ教というのは昼の世界を造る。昼の世界になるについて出現した宗教です。ですから今までの日本の宗教と違うんです。だから私の言う通りにやれば決して間違いない。裏があると思ったら間違いですね。だから素直になれ、というのはそういう意味ですね。素直にそのままやれば、すべてうまくいくんですね。』 ７ 人の意見を盲信せず必ず御神書を基準に判断すべき事 〔 御講話（S27年6月7日） 『御教え集』11号、昭和27(1952)年7月15日発行〕 『それからもう一つは、人からいろんなことを聞きますが、それを正面（まとも）に信ずるということが、これがまた危ないですね。だからいろんなことを聞いても、なるほど良い、しかしこれは神様の御趣旨に合っているかどうかということをまず考えてみて、どうも神様の御趣旨に合わない点もあるようだという場合には、御神書を見るんです――読むんです。そうするとたいていなことはどこかにありますから、それで判断をするということにしなければならない。そういうことで聞違えることがよくありますからね。最近こういうことがあったですね。ある信者で、メシヤ教は天国を造るんで、家庭も天国にしなければならない。そうするとお金は、つまり余ってからあげる。あげても経済的に差し障りがないだけの金をあげる。そうすれば金の苦しみがないから、それが本当のやり方だ。苦しんで金をあげるということは、やはり一つの苦しみを作るのだから、それは神様の御趣旨に合わない。昔からいう「信心は徳の余り」というわけですね。それを聞いて、ある信者は感心したんですよ。それがだんだん広がって――苦しんで金をあげるから、だから家庭が天国にならないんだということにまでなった。そうするとまた一方神様は今非常にお金が御入用だ。人間は少しは苦労をしても神様の方にあげなければならない。という両方の説が対立した。しかしどうも後の説が負けるんですよ。最初の方が勝っていくんですね。どうもゴタゴタしているので、私が呼んでよく話してやった。私の話はこういうわけです。最初の、家庭が困らないようにするということも合っている。確かにそれに違いない。それから、神様はお金はたくさん必要だから――はやく地上天国を造って救わなければならないので、どんなことをしても金をあげなければならない――どんなに苦しんでもあげなければならない、ということも合っている。両方とも合っているんだ。ただ大乗と小乗だ。最初の方は小乗的考え方ですね。後の方は大乗的考え方ですね。じゃ、後の方は金をあげて苦しむかというと、決して苦しまない。金をあげてそんな苦しむような神様だったら拝むのを止めたらいい。だから試しにあげてご覧なさい。苦しむようにあげてご覧なさい。十倍になって返ってきます。苦しむどころじゃない。たいへんな金にだぶついてくる。そう言ってやったので、両方とも――小乗的の方はよく解って、ついこの間、謝りに来ましたがね。そういうことがあるんですよ。ですからそういうことも心得ておかなければならないということを、今話したんですがね。』 ８ 明主様は間違って居れば注意されたが禁止されなかった事 〔 御講話（S27年4月1日） 『御垂示録』8号、昭和27(1952)年4月25日発行〕 『教団の中にも、間違った人や、いろいろな人がいますが、本当にいけなければ、私が注意を与えますがね。注意も、なすべからずとか、それを止めろとか――そういうことは言いませんがね。もし人が間違っても、この人は間違ったことをして、そのために覚るということもあるんだから、やはり頭をぶつけさせます。すると、ああ俺は間違っていたと覚ることもある。御神書を読んでも分らない人は自分で苦しむんですよ。それで覚りを開くということもある。間違ったことをさせておけば良いんですよ。「あの人はこういうことをしているが、あれは注意しなければいけない」と言うが、私は、「あの人は今に頭をぶつけるから、それから言ったほうが良い」と、その通り頭をぶっつけさせます。また人によっては、そういう苦しみをしなくても覚り得る人もある。そこで、人間はその人の行為によって善悪は決められない。それが大乗ですからね。そこまで心得て、そこまで信仰が深くなると、私はいろいろ言います。』 ９ 身魂（智慧証覚）相応にしか御教えは覚れぬ事 〔 御光話（S23年12月18日） 『御光話録』2号、昭和24(1949)年1月8日発行〕 ――時節柄、政治、戦争、大浄化などにつきまして、大先生様よりお言葉はいただけないことと存じますが、さらに御指導をいただくには適当な時期および場所を得てお伺い申し上げるべきでしょうか。あるいは平常このお席でうけたまわった程度を承知させていただけばよろしゅうございましょうか。 『ここで言ったことだけでいいです。第一、他のときに特別な人だけに話をすると不公平になります。「あの人に話して俺には話してくれない」なんて言われますから。それに神様には秘密がない。いつでも、まただれにでも話のできるべきものですから。……智慧証覚の進んだ人なら私の言葉の奥も判るはずです。そこまで行ってない人には言葉通りしか判らず、「ボンクラ」は言葉の半分くらい、もっと「ボンクラ」なら三分の一や五分の一くらいしか判らない。だから言葉の奥まで判るようになることが必要なんです。』 10 明主様の力徳も身魂相応にしかわからぬ事 〔 私の光 『地上天国』36号、昭和27(1952)年5月25日発行〕 『以上大体の説明であるが、これは私の力のホンの一部分であって、全体を説明するには容易ではない。何よりも今後私のやる仕事を活眼を開いて見て貰う事である。智性の働く人ならある程度分らないはずはない。信仰的にいえば身魂相応にとれるのだから、この意味からいっても、信者は精々身魂を磨き、曇りのないようにしておく事で、そうすれば正覚を得て私の力徳が分るはずである。』 11 明主様の御神格は時節と共に事実によって表われて来る事 〔 春季大祭御講話（S29年3月27日） 『御教え集』32号、昭和29(1954)年4月15日発行〕 （イエス・キリストの霊が本教信徒に憑り、明主様を「天の父」とお呼び申し上げたと言う御話の後で） 『それで私は自分自身ああこうと、ドエライことは言いたくないですから言わないのですが、だんだん時節に応じてそういうことが証拠立てられ、分からないわけにはゆかなくなってくるのです。』

―― 岡田自観師の論文集 ―― 御教え検索 ： help 資料検索 ： 伝道の手引き Ⅱ －２－２ 浄霊について 第二章 教師の人の為に １ 御教え通り病人をお世話する事 〔 御講話（S27年8月26日） 『御教え集』13号、昭和27(1952)年9月25日発行〕 『病気について注意したいことがあるのです。私が今までいろいろ言ったことをそのまま用いれば良いが、これはどうも人間の一つの癖ですが、人によっていろいろ――誇張したり縮めたりするのです。たいてい誇張するのです。それでとんだ間違いがあるのです。特に日本人はそうらしいのですが、物事をありのまま考えたりしない一つの癖があります。というのは、私はいろんな報告を聞きますが、その報告が人によってみんな違うのです。非常に掛け値を言う人と、割引をする人と両方ある。これは一つの例ですが、私の山をやっている者が二人あるのです。すると一人は非常に内輪に悲観的に言うのです。一人の方は、拡げて楽観的に言う癖がある。それで私は両方のちょうど間をとっているのです。こういう癖は非常にあるのです。人によっては馬鹿におおげさに言ったり、加減したりする。以前ある人で、今は信者の幹部になっている人ですが、なにかの報告の時に、あの人がああ言うのだからたいてい三割くらい割引をして思えばちょうど良いと、よく言ったものです。そういうような具合で、病気についてもよくあるのです。 最近聞いた話ですが、私が「大いに無理をしなければならない、無理をした方が健康になる」ということを言っているのですが、これは健康の場合には―― ちょうどスポーツマンがレコードを作るような具合で、無理をしただけずつは健康になるのですから結構ですが、病人は違うのです。肺病なんかの場合に「安静にしてはいけない、大いに運動しなければいけない」と言うそうです。病人の場合はとても大儀で苦しいのです。そういう具合でかえって浄化が強過ぎて衰弱しますから悪いのです。要するに根本は自然が良いのです。大儀で起きているのがつらい、寝たいと思う時は寝たら良いし、それからもう非常に具合が良くて寝ていてはつらい、起きて歩きたいというようなのは、起きて歩けば良い。要するに自然です。自然というのは、自然農法ばかりではないのです。病気に関しても自然です。だから食べたい物は食べたいだけ食べれば良い。ところがよく今までの習慣で、食べたい物を、よく毒だからいけないとか、食べたくないのに、それは病気に薬になるから食べろというのは間違いです。食べたいのは身体が要求しているのですから――咽喉が乾いて水を呑むようなものですから、そこで要求している通りにやれば良いのです。そこで今の、寝るとか起きるとかも身体の命ずるままにやれば一番良いのです。それを、どうも人間は自然がいけないようにいろいろ教育されてますから、かえって自然に逆らって苦しんだり、我慢したりすることが良いと――医学なんかは非常にそういうやり方になってますが、今言った通りどこまでも自然に、心のおもむくままにやることを心得ておくと良い。また滑稽なのは、昔私はリンゴを食べなかったが「明主様はリンゴは召し上がりませんが、リンゴは身体に悪いのですか」と言うから「そうではない、私はつゆ気の果物が好きで、リンゴはつゆ気がないから食べない」と話したことがある。それをどう間違えたか「明主様はリンゴを召し上がらないのは、リンゴは悪いのだ」というような宣伝ができたのです。ですからメシヤ教信者はリンゴを食べないということになった。実に滑稽なのです。リンゴでも柿でもなんでも、みんな神様が人間の食べる物に作ってあるのですから、リンゴがうまいという好きな人は大いに食べて良い。ところがもっと滑稽なのは、最近聞いた話で「リンゴは医学の方では薬になる」と言ってますが「医学では薬になるというところをみると、つまり薬になるのだ。するとリンゴを食べると薬毒が残る」と、こう言うのです。だからリンゴを食べてはいけないと言って、もらったりしても、リンゴを腐らせるのです。これはそうとう古い信者なのですが、そこまでいくと、実になんと言って良いか分からないです。』 附 救われた以上教えに従うべき事 〔 御教え（S27年2月27日） 『御教え集』7号、昭和27(1952)年3月20日発行〕 ６－③「産後無理をした場合」参照（原典では省略されているが収録） 「高柳龍子（三年前入信。三十七歳）。昨年十二月四人目の出産をいたし、御守護により安産でありましたのと、従来の習慣にて、その日より便所に通いました。翌日の御教えに産後の御注意をいただきましたので、さっそくお伝えいたしましたが、たいして気にも止めない様子でございました。四日目に頭部に激痛を覚え、頭が割れるようで十日間続き軽くなりました。産後にもかかわらず腹部が膨脹し尿量も少なく、ついに全身に浮腫みを生じ、血痰を激しく吐き呼吸困難を起すようになりました。二回目の呼吸困難があり、御浄霊いただき楽になりましたが、全身的浮腫は取れません。三回目に及び、全身浮腫は以前よりはなはだしく、特に腹部はパンパンに膨れさがりました。一月末大光明如来様を御奉斎させていただきました。三カ月に及びますが、変化がございませんのは、御浄霊の急所が違っているのでございましょうか。また霊的に関係がございましょうか。なお、姑が入信後亡夫（金光教と禅宗の両方で祀っております）の慰霊のために、金光教会にお参りいたしましても差し支えございませんでしょうか。」 『これはいけないな。こんな習慣なんてありゃしないですよ。これは、この人の習慣ですよ。もっとも、ひとのみちの信者はやりますが、これは嘘ですよ。こういうことは以前から言ってありますがね。書いてありますがね。一週間は絶対便所に行ってはいけませんよ。頭が割れるよう――言うことを聞かないからだ。金光教会に――差し支えありませんよ。亡夫は信者だったんだからね。あるいは、まだ金光教に執着があるかもしれないからね。お詣りしても良し、しなくても良し、任意で良いですがね。これは霊的じゃない。たいして気に止めない――これは、その通りやらなかったんですか。』 「いたしておりませんようでございます。前三回が非常に楽なお産をいたしておりますために。」 『そのためです。そのお詫びですよ。それを本人が心からお詫びすれば、それで治りますよ。浄霊は結構だけれども、そのお咎めですよ。信者になった以上―― じゃない、メシヤ教の浄霊で救ってもらった以上――つまり私のやり方を言って、その通りやらなかったら救われっこないですね。だから、そのお詫びをするんです。頭に激痛――これは、祖霊さんが戒告したんです。それでも気がつかないんでお腹が膨脹したりしたんです。それで治るわけですがね。本人が心からお詫びしなければ駄目ですね。』 ２ どの程度に浄霊を頂くべきか １ 浄化のない時は浄霊を頂く必要はない事 〔 御光話（S25年 2月） 『御光話録』18号、昭和25(1950)年4月23日発行〕 『それから、熱もなくなんの苦痛もないときには浄霊しなくたっていいですよ。どっか苦しいときに浄霊を受けるのは結構ですが、なんともないときに、なにも浄化を起すことはありませんよ。かえってよけいな手数がかかるだけですからね、そんなのは嘘ですよ。』 ２ 徳を積めば御浄化の頂ける事 〔 教えの光（地上天国22号) 、昭和26(1951)年3月25日発行〕 「御浄霊は浄化したときだけやればよいということを伺いましたが、積極的に御光をいただき、浄化を求めるため、御浄霊を受けるのはいかがでございましょうか。」 『そんな必要はない。なぜなれば無浄化の際浄霊をすると非常に骨が折れるからである。それよりも、浄化を起したいとしたら、信仰によって徳を積めば、魂が浄まるから、自然浄化が起るので、それが本当の信仰である。』 附 信仰が熱心でも浄化の頂けぬのは 〔 御垂示（S26年9月8日） 『御垂示録』2号、昭和26(1951)年10月10日発行〕 「信者の方で、長い間熱心に、資格もいただきやってますが、薬でとことんまでいって、このお道に入りましたが、それだけの薬を飲んだ浄化をいただかない。他の人はいただいているので、それが羨ましい。自分はそれまでいかないのだろうかと言ってましたが、いかがでございましょうか」 『どこかはずれている所があるでしょう。無論、飲んでいる以上は出ますが、薬によって強いのと弱いのとあるから、一概にはいかない。その人が熱心にやったからよいというのではなく、線にはずれていてはあまり良くない。線に合っているということは、どこかというと、信者を多勢救うとか、支部をつくるということです。その褒美が神様からくるわけです。そうなると、智慧ということも必要になる。一生懸命にやるといっても――結果ですよ。一生懸命も結構ですが、ただ、結果が現れなければね。何彼（なにか）に言うより、結果ですよ。そういうことは、怠けているようでも、あんまり感心しなくても、確かに信者ができるなら、それが救いですからね。それが一番です。』 ３ 浄化が激しくなって来たからよく御浄霊を頂く必要がある事 〔 立春祭御講話（S27年2月5日） 『御教え集』7号、昭和27(1952)年3月20日発行〕 『近ごろは浄化が非常に強くなってきた。信者の人で、浄化の強い人が随分――これは、信者の人もみんな知ってますがね。なかなか、古い人でも、かなり強い浄化が起るんですね。で、信仰の固まっている人は、どんな強い浄化でも、それを逃れますけれども、少しフラフラしている人は、なかなか危ないことがあります。けれども、結局は救われますけれどもね。たまには、子供やなにかの身代わりなんてのがありますから、よほどしっかり信仰を握っていなければ負けですね。ですから、今日を過ぎたら、面会のたびに、最後に私が五分か十分くらい、みんなを浄霊してやろうと思ってます。浄化のために活動に影響するといけないですから、できるだけそういうことのないように、やってあげようと思ってます。 それから、御神業の方も――一昨年あの事件があった時に、散花結実――このことを話もし、書いてもあげましたがね。去年あたりが、ちょうど花が散って、実の中心ですね――実の芯がやっと、しっかり芽が出たというような意味でしたが、今年からだんだん育って行く形なんですね。育っていくということは、要するに表面的の活動になるわけです。』 ３ 霊的疾患について １ 霊的疾患と体的疾患と見分け得るか 〔 御光話（S24年4月特輯号） 『御光話録』6号、昭和24(1949)年4月23日発行〕 『これは病気によっては、はっきり判るけれども、はっきり判らない病気もある。私にも最初から判る場合と、しばらく経たなければ判らない場合とあります。また、体的と霊的と一緒になっている場合もありますしね。 こんな場合もあるから、これは知っておかねばなりませんね。肺病でね、最初は体的なただの浄化で、だんだん霊的になってくることがあります。これは体が弱ってきたために血が少なくなって、それで霊が憑りやすくなるためです。精神病、癲癇、小児麻痺などは頭から霊的としてほとんど間違いありません。ただ、小児麻痺で、片方の足だけ動かないなんていう場合には体的なためによることがありますがね。肺病には霊的のものと、体的のものと、霊的と体的と一緒になったのとあります。胃や腸の病気には霊的のは少ないですね。それから、婦人病には霊的のが多くて、多くは生霊ですね。霊にも人間霊と動物霊とありますしいろいろです。まあ経験とその人の霊感の働きによって見分けることですね。』 ――癲癇には薬毒のためのものはありませんでしょうか。 『ありません。ただ癲癇に似たものはあります。後頭部に薬毒の固結があって、そのために痙攣するんですよ。これは治りいいですね。』 附 霊が憑るのも根本は薬毒である事 〔 御教え（S26年9月11日） 『御教え集』2号、昭和26(1951)年10月25日発行〕 『それから霊が憑るということは、そこに曇りがあるので、曇りがないと憑れない。曇りというのは薬の毒ですからね。どこかに病気とか、苦痛があれば、いつ薬をのんだか――あの時の薬だ、ということで分かります。病気はなんでも薬だと思えば間違いない。なんでも霊的だ、霊的だと言うのは――そんなに思わないようにした方が良いですね。精神病や癲癇は絶対に霊的ですがね。他の――痛いとか痒いとか、熱が出るとか――そういうのはみんな薬ですからね。ここが痛いというのは、いつの薬だろうと考えると分かる。』 ２ 霊憑りの人を扱うのは有効か有事か 〔 教えの光（地上天国29号) 、昭和26(1951)年10月25日発行〕 「最近各支部の月並祭後、信者を浄霊中、自然に憑霊現象が起るようになり、なにかといろいろ霊界または霊的のことを勉強させられております。よく信者の御先祖が救いを求めて出られたり「位牌を作ってくれ」とか、「位牌の祀り方の傾が違うから直してくれ」と出られますので、できる限りのことはしておりますが、ある先生のお話などを聞くところによれば「あまり親切に霊の救いをすると、いくらでもたよってきて限りないし、そうしたことをしていると物質までみんな０（ゼロ）になる」と言われます。私は頼ってくるからにはみんな霊線がつながっているから頼ってくるのであって、むちゃくちゃに頼るわけはないと思います。なお霊を救ってやれば必ず感謝の想念はいつかは物質化するものと思われますが、いかがなものでございましょうか。右に対し、なにとぞよろしく御教示のほどお願い申し上げます。」 『右のようなある先生には困ったものである。○○の一つ覚えのように、融通がきかないのだから。こういう先生は、千変万化、自由無碍、応身の教えに外れている。この意味によって霊的事象も、人により所により、時によって正邪、善悪いろいろある。これを見分けて適当に処理することが、できるようになれば一人前の本教信者である。 従って、この人の憑霊は、この人にこの御用があるのだから、なんら心配なくやればいいのである。すべて人によりそれぞれ違った御用があるのだから、単なる自己判断で決めるのは最も間違っているから、その点よく心得てもらいたいのである。ちょうど芝居に例えればよく判る。いろいろな役があるからおもしろい芝居ができるのと同じである。』 ３ 信徒が浄霊の際霊媒になるのは構わぬか 〔 御光話（S25年 4月 8日） 『御光話録』19号、昭和25(1950)年6月13日発行〕 ――熱心な一信者、よく憑霊状態になりますが、その霊は非常に御光を頼り、御浄霊をいただく人や迷い疑う人々に、御光を早くいただいてお観音様のお手伝いをするようにとすすめます。この場合居合わせた人は、これによって熱心になる場合がございます。神懸りが正しくないとすれば、霊憑りも正しい信仰ではないと思いますが、被浄霊者に霊媒能力のある場合にはいかがいたしたらよろしいでしょうか。 『これはたいへんな間違いだな。霊憑りが正しい信仰でないなんて、そんなことはありませんよ。……この人は正しいんですよ。霊の言うことが正しければそれは正しいんです。そして霊の言うことが正しいか正しくないかってのは常識で判断するんですよ。「この方は神じゃ」なんて言って、いろんなことを命令したりするのは正しくないんです。そんなのは狐のいたずらですからね。先にもありましたがね、狐が始終指図してね、「いますぐどこどこへ行け」とか「これを食べると死んじゃうぞ」とか言うんですが、これも狐にたぶらかされてるんですよ。 けど、こういうのは正しいんですよ。祖霊の中のだれかがやってるんですね。祖霊は、子孫が早くいいことをしないとその家が早く救われないってことが充分判ってるんで、そうやって知らせてるんですよ。だからこれはいいんです。』 ４ 浄霊者の霊位により憑依霊の態度の異なる事 〔 御光話（S23年11月28日） 『御光話録』2号、昭和24(1949)年1月8日発行〕 ――御浄霊により病人が霊的動作を表わすことがございますが、その御浄霊する先生によりあるいはその土地により相違がありますようですが、これはなぜでございましょうか。 『これは無論ありますよ。憑いている霊がその先生より上の場合と下の場合があり、上の場合には「お前さんには言えない」と言うし、下の場合には「お前さんは偉いから話をする」と言う。狐なんか殊にそうですが、結局それは光の多い人に頭を下げるわけです。……霊が浮くというのは光により苦しくなって浮いてくる場合と、また霊によっては憑いてからまだ短時日だと浮きやすいということもあります。土地ということにはあまり関係ないが、土地により霊懸りの多いのと少ないのとはあります。狐の親玉なんかがいればその辺には子分がたくさんいますから。』 ――よく、その先生に力があるからだとか、あるいはその先生にそんな霊が憑いているから同じようなのが集まるのだとも聞きますが……？ 『その先生によるということはあります。が、その人により霊が集まるということはないですね。』 ４ 浄化の治りにくい主な理由 １ 手に力が入っている場合 〔 御講話（S28年10月15日） 『御教え集』27号、昭和28(1953)年11月15日発行〕 『それからよく御守護の電報が来ることがありますが、今どこが悪いとかどこが痛いとかありますが、それを読んでみると別にたいした病気ではないのです。浄霊でもわけなく治るような症状なのです。それがどういうわけかというと、浄霊に力が入るせいです。だから治りが悪いのです。それで浄霊してどうも治りが悪いというときには、力が入るからだということを心得ておくとよいです。この力を抜くということは、むしろ難しいです。しかもだんだん浄化が強くなるに従って、ますます光が強くなるから、そうすると光を出すには力を抜くほど出るのです。少しでも力を入れると光の出が悪くなるのです。妨げるわけです。力を抜くということは、これ以上は抜けないというところまで抜かなければならないのです。力が入るのと入らないのではたいへんな違いです。私などもそうで、浄霊していても、ちょっと力が入っていると治りが違います。この力を抜くと何倍もよく治ります。』 附 力をぬくについて 1 〔 御垂示（S28年10月1日） 『御垂示録』25号、昭和28(1953)年10月15日発行〕 『つまり浄霊してどうも治りが悪いというときには、確かに力が入るのだから、できるだけ力を抜けばずっと治るようになります。なにしろ御守りから霊光が出て、掌から出るのですから、ちょっとでも力が入ると、霊光を塞いでしまうのです。やっぱり人間の力で神様の霊光を塞いでしまう、と言うよりか、薄くしてしまうのです。そこに気がつけばよいのです。ですから一生懸命に御浄霊をするということがいけないのです。前にも言ったとおり、一生懸命ではなく、逆に楽な気持ちでやるというほうがずっと効果があります。だから、思うよう――ということも少し変で、その人の思いようによるが、割合に治りが悪いというときには力が入っているのだということが一番です。浄霊しながら鼻歌でもうたいたいくらいの気持ちでやるのが一番よいのです。それで、神様にお願いするのはいくら一生懸命になってもよいのです。それは構いませんが、ただ浄霊の場合には自分が治すのではないので、神様に治していただく、自分はその道具だから、そのつもりになっていればよいわけです。私などもやっぱりそうです。少しでも力が入ると治りが悪いのです。もちろんお腹の光が出る場合にも、力というのは腕力ですが、それが出るわけですから、それだけ光が薄くなるわけです。だからよくお蔭話に「一生懸命にお浄霊をさせていただいて、どう」ということがありますが、あれはどうも具合が悪いです。そうかと言って、力を入れないで霊が通らなければいけないから、そこが難しいところです。通そうとすると力が入るから、力を抜いて霊を通すようにするのですが、それが一つの修業です。』 附 力をぬくについて 2 〔 御講話（S28年5月16日） 『御教え集』10号、昭和27(1952)年6月15日発行〕 『苦しがって七転八倒すると、かえってボンヤリして、なにを苦しんでやがるんだというつもりでね。ですから、自分の力とか、治そうとする熱意とか、そういうものは出さないんです。なんだこんなもの、といったような、要するに一生懸命にならないことです。そうすると良く効くんです。だからそれには力を抜くことですね。そこのところが、一つの修行ですね。』 附 力をぬくについて 3 〔 御講話（S28年5月17日） 『御教え集』10号、昭和27(1952)年6月15日発行〕 『よく、一生懸命にやるということを言いますがね。お蔭話なんかにも書いてありますが、一生懸命にやるとどうしても力が入る。だからそこを間違えないようにしなければならないですね。一生懸命にならない方が良く治る。一生懸命になると人間の力の方が多くなるから、神様の力の方が薄くなる。治してあげたいというのは結構ですが、治すのに一生懸命になるというのは、いけないんです。だから、ぜんぜん一生懸命にならないで、ごく軽い気持ちというよりか――軽い気持ちというとかえって徹底しないので――まあ、どうでも良い、ええい面倒くさいと、そういう気持ちが良いんです。私はそういう気持ちでやっているんです。どうせ、うんと薬を服みやがったんだから、自業自得だ。だからまあかわいそうだから治してやるんだけれども、そうなにも一生懸命になる必要はないというような――極端ですが、そういうような気持ちでやる方がかえって治る。すると、神様のお力の方が強くなって、人間力の方が弱くなるから治るんです。痛みなんか、ごく力を入れないでやるとじき治るんです。軽い気持ちで、霊が通れば良いんですからね。それで霊を通そうとすると力が入るんです。そこが難しい。だから力をできるだけ抜いて霊を通そうとする。そうするとだんだん慣れてきますからね。』 ２ 急所外れの浄霊と信仰が理屈に合わぬ事 〔 御講話（S28年7月6日） 『御教え集』24号、昭和28(1953)年8月15日発行〕 『病気などは特にそうですが、急所の発見ということが一番肝腎なのです。それからこの前も言ったとおり、理屈に合わないことはいけないと言ったが、いくら一生懸命にやっても、その人を浄霊すべき条件が理屈に合わないと、いくら一生懸命にやっても治らないのです。これはこの前話したから大体分かっているでしょうが、その理屈に合わないことという一つの条件というのは、神様のことを知った人とぜんぜん知らない人とはたいへん違うのです。知らない人はたいへん無礼なことをしても、これは知らないから許されます。ところが信仰にはいってそうとうたって、知っているはずのところの人が、理屈に合わないとお蔭がないわけです。そういうこともよく考えるべきことです。やってみて、どうしても思うようにゆかないということは、自分の浄霊の霊力が弱いのだろうとかいろんなことを思うが、そういうことはごく少ないので、本当は急所を外れていることと条件が理屈に合わないことが一番多いのだから、そういうことに気がつくようにならなければならないです。それはその人の智慧証覚です。だからまず智慧証覚を磨くということが一番肝腎です。智慧証覚が磨けると急所の発見が早いのです。』 ３ 浄霊を頂く方の信仰が理屈に合わぬ場合 ２－９ 「信仰の合理性について」参照（原典では省略だが収録） １ 救いと律法との関係 〔 御講話（S28年5月26日） 『御教え集』22号、昭和28(1953)年6月15日発行〕 『神様は愛ですが、理屈に合わなければ神様はどうしようもないのです。神様は御利益をいくらでも与えたいのです。ところが資格がないのです。たとえてみれば金銭にしても、神様はいくらでもザルなり財布なりに入れてあげたいのですが、この財布の中に汚いものがあるから入れられないのです。それを掃除すればよいのです。ですから人間の方で命を助かりたい時には、人間の方で助かる状態にすればよいのです。それをしてないから、神様の方にも規則がありますから、神様自身がその規則を外すことはできないから、助けたくても助けられないということになります。』 ２ 神様に対して順序を尊ぶべき事 〔 御光話（S24年 3月 8日） 『御光話録』5号、昭和24(1949)年＊月＊日発行〕 ――ではお道、順序ということは固く言うべきでしょうか。 『ええ、言わなければいけません。理の立つことなら言っていいんです。』 １－17 「浄霊御礼について」を参照（原典では省略だが収録） 〔 御光話（S24年 9・10月) 『御光話録』15号、昭和24(1949)年12月20日発行〕 ――貧困な人達を見ても一様に同情せず、その美しい心の持ち主に対してはきっと将来救われると思い、その醜い心の持ち主に対しては当然そうなるべき因縁を持つのだ……というふうに考えますことは無慈悲な心でしょうか。 『これはね、どっちって決められないんですよ。例えば浄霊にしても、その人が丸ッきり金がないんなら施療にしてやってあげてもいいが、いくぶんでも出せれば出すべきです。人間的な考えも大切だが、それはよほど違うこともあるんです。教導師が人を浄霊してあげた場合、生活に費用がかかるんだから、御礼をもらうのはあたりまえです。そして余裕があれば神様にお上げするのが本当ですよ。だから、御礼は身分に応じてするのがいいんです。だから施療なんかしてる間は嘘ですよ。ふつうの人は施療なんかできないんですから。 以前、ただで治療しろって言う人がいましたが、勿論、観音様は御礼なんかいらないが、取り次ぎする人は家に住んでいるんだし、まさかカスミを食って生きるわけには行かないですからね。……金持ちはうんと御礼を出したらいいんです。生命を救われたら財産の半分くらい出したらいいんですよ。だから、私は以前よく言ったんです。御礼はまだもらってない、手数料ならもらったけどってね。（笑声）実際、生命を救われるってことはたいへんですからね。だからね、心よく出せる御礼は出すのが本当であり、また受け取るのが本当なんですよ。 以前、ある熱心な婦人で人を大勢やってたんですが、その御札が一円のところを二、三円多いからって返しに行ったんだそうです。これはその婦人の御主人から聞いたんですがね。しかし、これなんかとんでもない間違いですよ。神様を侮辱することはなはだしい。一生懸命やってながらまったく見当が外れてるんです。で、その婦人は震災で死んでしまいましたがね。』 〔 御光話（S24年 7月23日） 『御光話録』13号、昭和24(1949)年10月21日発行〕 「経済的に不遇な方が、さらに病気などの御浄化をいただいております場合、その人が一日も早く健康にさせていただけますように……との気持ちから、その人には話さずに（従って御玉串もお上げすることなしに）教導師が神様に御守護をお願いいたすことはよろしいでしょうか。」 『これはね、なかなか厄介なんですよ。できるだけ御礼をやすくしてやるとか、場合によっては貧乏人にはただでしてやるといったふうに社会事業的にするのは一応もっともなことですがね、しかし、これはたいへんな間違いなんですよ。いままでのたいした御利益のない宗教ならいいが、このすばらしい神様には感謝するのがあたりまえですよ。以前、私がやっていた時分、ある細君でとても熱心でしたが、ある人がやってもらった御礼を置いてったら多すぎるからって返した人がありましたがね、これはたいへんな間違いですよ。いくら一生懸命でも根本が違ってますからね。その細君は震災のとき水に溺れて死んでしまいましたがね。……ですからちょっとここの考え方が難しいんですよ。 不思議なことにはね、私がしていたとき御礼を高くするほど人が大勢やって来たもんですよ。……まったく、これで救われた感謝は金には替えられませんからね。先にもね、どれくらい御礼したらいいかっていう人があるんで、ありがたいと思う気持ちだけでいい、本当に御礼するとしたらたいへんだから、（笑声）その時分で、まあ、十万円くらいはしなけりゃならない、（笑声）だからあんたのできるだけでいいって言ったんです。……実際、価値には替えられませんからね。いままでのは、まあ一銭上げて家内安穏、商売繁昌、無病息災、なんて願ったもんでしたがね。（笑声）だから、そういった意味でただでやってやるのはいけません。その人が罪をきてしまうんです。神様から御利益をいただいてるのに御礼をしないってのは罪ですからね。だから治ってから御礼するのは嘘で、治る前に御礼……お願いをするのが本当ですよ。なぜなら、治ってから御礼をするんでは神様を雇ってることになる。ちょうど人を雇って、これだけ働いたからこれだけ御礼するっていうのと同じですからね。これじゃ人間のほうが上になって神様は下になってしまうんです。だから、そのやってもらう前に誠を捧げて神様にお願いすべきなんです。 まあ、こんなことはいまの人にはちょっと納得できないかもしれませんがね。いままでのは御礼を上げても死んでしまったことが多いんですが、しかしこれは神様が悪いんじゃなくて、取り次ぎをする人が悪いんです。悪意でやったんじゃなくても結果的に悪くなってしまうんですがね。まあ、根本はこうなんですから、この根本を知ってあとは臨機応変にやったらいいんです。』（『御光話録』五号参照） 〔 教えの光（地上天国24号) 、昭和26(1951)年5月25日発行〕 「私はある婦人を御浄霊しておりますが、死一歩手前を御守護によって御救いいただきましたが、主人は無能力で働くことが大嫌いで、本人主人とも御教修はいただきましたが、感謝の念が薄いようで約一年余の間、御礼はぜんぜんいたしません。 右のような場合御礼をいただかないで御浄霊をしても、神様からお許しいただけるのでございましょうか。それとも一時本人が目醒めるまで放任していたほうがよろしいでしょうか。」 『放任したほうがよろしい。そんな恩知らずの面倒をみるのは、神様にもったいないのである。時期が来て、本人が心から目醒め、おすがりしてくれば、神様にお詫びして、御救いを願えばよいのである。』 ４ 執着が邪魔する場合 ２－11 「危険な時は生命の執着を取るべき事」参照 （原典では省略） 〔 御講話（S28年6月25日） 『御教え集』23号、昭和28(1953)年7月15日発行〕 『それから私は前から言おうと思ってはいましたが、これで気がついたので言います。重病の場合でもう治る見込みがないという時に「どんなになっても、まだそんな失望するにあたらないから、しっかりしていろ」と言って慰めますが、これは本当言うといけません。やはり生の執着が御守護の邪魔をするのです。治すのは、正守護神が神様の方から力をいただいて、自分がお取り次ぎして治すのですが、その場合に生の執着があると、正守護神の思うとおりにならないのです。本人や周囲の者の執着心が邪魔するので、治る場合も治らないということも大いにあります。ですからこれからは、もう駄目だと思ったら、早く本人に諦めさせるのです。「これはもう駄目だ、死ぬ覚悟をしなさい」と言った方が、かえって助かるのです。 このことは私も経験がありますが、私は二十八の時にチフスをし、自分でもとても助かるとは思えないので遺言をしたのです。それは前の家内の時で、当時小間物屋だったが、「自分はもう駄目だから、自分が死んだら商売は誰々に任して、こういうようにしろ」と言ったくらいですから、ぜんぜん生の執着が取れたのです。それで知っている人の兄が医学博士で、病院が近くにあるのでそこに頼んだのです。そうするとその医者が来て診た結果、これは入院しても助かる見込みはない。助かる見込みのない者をみすみす入れるということは、病院の信用を落とすからお断りすると断られたのです。ところがそのころの私の家は狭くて、起居する部屋は二部屋しかないので、もしもの時に大勢人が来ても狭いから、死んでもよいから入院させてくれと、院長の弟が友達だったからその方から頼んで、やっとはいったのです。それでその当時は自動車はなくて人力車でしたが、人力車にも乗れなかったので、担架に乗って担いでもらって行ったのです。そして寝ながら町を歩いている人を見て、これで人を見るのも見おさめだと思ったのです。そうしたら夢とも現（うつつ）ともなく墓場が見えてしようがなかったのです。それで自分は駄目だとよけい思われました。しかしどうやら息はつながっているのです。そうして非常に強い薬で、この薬が効かなければもう駄目だと言われたが、それをのまされるとその苦しいの苦しくないの、実に苦しかったです。それでも死なずにいました。そこで係の医者が、最初の見立ては肺炎だというのですが、その医者は肺炎とは思えない、チフスと思うから試験してみようというので、発泡薬というのでツユを取るのですが、ツユを取って顕微鏡で見たら、確かにチフスだということで、チフスの手当てをしなければならないということになったのです。チフスは絶対流動物であって、チフスには薬はないのです。それから絶対流動物で、だんだんよくなって治ったのです。そういうようで、生の執着を取ったことがよかったのです。 それには本人が肝腎なのです。本人に「あなたはもう駄目だから諦めなさい」と言い渡した方がよいです。それから本人ばかりでなく、親や周囲の近親者も大事なのです。近親者の執着の霊が邪魔します。ですから霊の邪魔というのが非常に重大なのです。それはそれとして、家の中に非常に反対している者がある場合に、反対している者は「もしか治ると自分が恥をかいたりするから、どうしても治らないように」と一生懸命に思うその霊がまた非常に邪魔をするのです。そこで、執着はなんにでもいけませんが、執着はどこまでも逆効果になるということを心得ておかなければいけません。』 〔 御講話（S28年6月27日） 『御教え集』23号、昭和28(1953)年7月15日発行〕 『また家族の者が「どうか助けたい」というその執着が、やっぱり邪魔します。それからさらにまた家族の者に信仰に反対の者がいる場合に、もし治ると自分の面目がつぶれますから、どうしても助からないようにしたいという執着は一番恐ろしいです。これは一番悪性です。治らないようにする執着ですから一番悪いのです。ですから家族に反対者があった場合には結果が悪いのはそういうわけです。だからなにごとも執着が非常に災いするのです。』 〔 御講話（S28年6月27日） 『御教え集』23号、昭和28(1953)年7月15日発行〕 （御論文「 超奇蹟 」）【栄光 二一八号】 『今読んだとおりですが、陰茎の方は、三分の一くらいを手術で切って元通りに伸びたということは以前聞いたことがありますが、睾丸が取れて元通りになったということは実に奇蹟以上です。よく昔から「睾丸を一つつぶせば命はない」と言われてますが、金玉一つどころでなく二つともなくなったのです。それで生きているだけでなく元通りになったのですから、どう考えても分からないことです。ですからこれは世界的問題として大いに人類に知らせる必要があると思います。このことは神様の方ではチャンと分かります。しかしこれを説明したところで、あまりに神秘でちょっと信じられないというかも分かりません。いずれ時期が来たらこういう説明もしますが、今のところは致し方ないわけです。 それでこういう場合に一番肝腎なことは執着です。神様に非常にお願いし祈るということも結構なのですが、そこに難しい点があるのです。というのは、あまりに「助けたい」「助かりたい」というその執着が邪魔することになるのです。だからお願いしお祈りするのはよいですが、ある程度までであっさりとしておくのです。「どうしても助かりたい、助かりたい」という強い執着は取るのです。むしろそういう時には「命のないものなら早く霊界にやらしていただきたい、助かるものなら助けていただきたい」とあっさりするのです。そういう時にあっさりするということは非常に難しいですが、その執着の心が非常に邪魔するのです。そういう時に助けるのは正守護神で、正守護神が神様に力をいただいて助けるのですが、正守護神の霊が働くのです。そういう時に側の者があんまり強い執着ですと、正守護神が働く場合に邪魔になるのです。そこで逆効果になるわけです。その点をよく知らなければいけません。』

『霊界は全く想念の世界である以上、無から有を生じ、有が無になり変異極まりないものである。』 （中略） 『今一つは、すべて礼拝の的である御神体に対し、礼拝者が誠をもって心から念願する場合、その神霊の威力、すなわち光明は偉力を発揮するに反し、礼拝者の想念が形式だけで、心からの尊信の念がない場合、神霊の偉力はそれだけ減殺されるのである。また礼拝者が多数あればある程、神威弥々（いよいよ）赫々（かくかく）たる光明を増すのである。』 〔 御講話（S28年6月27日） 『御教え集』23号、昭和28(1953)年7月15日発行〕 『今言う「ぜひ命を助けていただきたい、病気を治していただきたい」というと、神様の方では「お前は信仰にはいっているのだろう。オレの方でうまくやってやる。そんなにセッツイテ頼まなくてもよい。そんなにオレを不人情に見られてはおもしろくない。お前の方で頼っている以上、オレはお前の命はどんなにしても助けてやる」ということになります。従来の信仰で、水浴び、断食、お百度参りなどをしたら助けてやろうというのは本当の神様ではないのです。やっぱり邪神です。それで神様の愛は大きく深いのですから、人間次第なのです。人間の方で頼ってお任せする以上、神様は任せられる以上は助けないわけにはゆかないというわけですから、神様としては任せられる以上一番責任が重くなるわけです。ですから神様にお任せするということになると、神様の方でも大いに助けよいのです。その考えですが、やっぱり小乗と大乗の考え方です。それで神様としては、神様の役に立つ者はどうしても助けます。それから邪魔したり役に立たない人間は、その人間が分かるまでは手を引かれて時を待たれるのです。神様というのは、今の睾丸ができたというように、たいへんな御力で、助けようと思えばなんでもないのです。ただ助かる条件が揃わないのです。ですから人間の方でその条件に持って行けばよいのです。』

「井関勇吉（五十九歳）。昭和十五年夏ごろ、たいへんに疲労を覚え、医診の結果糖尿病とのことで、毎日インシュリン、ブドウ糖の注射をし、内服薬も用い、食事は糖分は控え目に、魚肉類を多く摂るようにしておりました。昭和十六年バセドー氏病を併発し、疲労感がいっそう加わり、十九年九月ごろ一時小康を得ましたが、月に面疔および鼻梁軟骨炎を併発し、約三カ月床につき、インシュリンの代用薬ミニグリン、インペリンなどの注射をうち、手術はいたしませんでしたが、鼻、眼の縁から排膿し、漸次快復に向かいました。二十三年秋ごろから眼が充血し、視力減退し、医診の結果、腎臓病併発のため眼底出血し、失明の直前で、同時に糖尿病も悪化し、放置すれば生命が危険とのことで入院し、毎食前にインシュリン、ビタミンＣ、ニッサリジンなど注射および服薬し、一週二回眼球の注射などを三カ月続けました。他に漢方薬、ニワトコ、木ササギ、トウモロコシなども一カ月ほど服薬いたしましたが、思わしくありませんでした。二十五年五月、本教の福音をうけたまわり、御浄霊をいただき、七月に退院し、一切の医薬を廃し、御浄霊におすがりするようになりましてより、身動きもできなかったお腹の膨れも、だんだんと引き、楽になり、ほとんど盲目に近かった視力もやや恢復し、少しずつ読み書きもできるまでになりましたので、二十五年秋から二十六年秋まで公務のために身心を使い、それまでいただいておりました会長先生および支部長先生の御浄霊も怠りがちとなり、またまた悪化し、御浄化が激しくなってまいりました。その間指導者の方々より、先生方の御浄霊はでき得る限り多くいただき、また御高恩にお報い奉るべく人々をお救いするようにとお話いただきながら、忙しさや我事に追われ、御報恩も意に任せず、御浄霊もたまにいただく程度にて、まことに申し訳なく心よりお詫び申し上げております。今日では頭から足の指先まで腫れ上がり、腹部は太鼓のようで、副睾丸は握り拳三つほどの大きさに腫れ、横臥することもできません。昨年末より咳をしきりにいたし、濃い痰が出るようになり、体を動かしますと咳が出て、腹部に力が入り、膨満と咳の圧迫のためにか、副睾丸が痛み、呼吸が困難になります。一月七日、代人にて御参拝させていただきましたが、代人出立の日御守護いただき下痢をいたし、同時に副睾丸はだんだん小さくなり、咳激しく、痰も多量に出させていただき、だいぶ楽にさせていただきました。なお、下痢は未だ激しく続いておりますが、三日前より異常な眠気を催しております。現在もっとも苦しいのは、腹部膨満のため胸部圧迫され、胸元が息苦しい状態でございます。尿量は非常に少なくなっております。御浄霊は一日四、五回いただいております。なお、今回も代人にて御参拝させていただいております。光明如来様、御屏風観音様は御奉斎させていただき、ひたすらおすがりさせていただいておりますが、御浄霊の急所御教示のほどお願い申し上げます。」 『これは、急所は――命を救われたことを忘れたことが急所です。大体この人は命がなかったんです。これは非常な薬毒ですよ。医学の犠牲者ですね。気の毒なものですね。そうして、せっかく務めができるまでに治ったら、すぐに神様のために働かなければならない。命は神様にいただいたんですからね。だから、私有物じゃない。助かってからの命は神有物なんです。ところが自分勝手にしたから御守護が離れたんです。だから、こういうことになるのはあたりまえです。だから、そこを自覚しなければならない。神様からいただくということは、神様の御用をしろと言っていただくんですから、そういうのは神様以外のことはできないんです。こういうのはたくさんあるんです。ところが、それを私有物にして、せっかくいただいた命を勝手に使って――いったん神様からいただいた命を、会社かなにかに使っては、人が助かりません。そうでなく――神様は、命をやるから御神業に使えと言ってくださったんです。それを忘れた。この点は指導者も責任があります。それは言ったでしょう。しかし、言い方が足りなかった。断乎として言えば――他のことをしては命はない。神様以外のことはいけないと、断乎として言うんです。それで言うことを聞かなければ、突っ離す。だから、浄霊も良いですが、腹の中から――間違っていた。今度治ったら人助けをさせていただく。だから、もう一ぺん、命をいただきたいとお願いするんですね。それで、神様が聞き届けられたら、助かりますが、神様がもう駄目だ――なかなか神様は、そういうところは厳しいですからね。もう駄目だ。お前は霊界に行って働けと言われたら、もうしかたがないですがね。』 〔 御講話（S28年5月15日） 『御教え集』22号、昭和28(1953)年6月15日発行〕 『本当は再浄化というものは起るべきものではありません。しかし起るべきものではないと言っても、ある程度はやむを得ないが、再浄化で命がなくなるということはありません。再浄化のあるのは、ほとんど結核ですが、医者から見放されてぜんぜん死ぬに決まったような者が助けられるとしたら、その命の恩はたいへんなものですから、いかなるものを犠牲にしても、命の代わりとして感謝しなければなりません。感謝するということは奉仕しなければならないのです。それをボヤボヤしているから、神様は横を向かれるのはあたりまえです。だから再浄化が起るということは、再浄化が起るようにしているのです。それで今の人はやっぱり医学迷信のために、お医者でなおったのは非常にありがたがるのです。ところが信仰でなおったのは有難味が少ないのです。というのは、信仰でなおるべきものではないと思っているから、「なおったのは時節が来たのではないか」あるいは「今までたくさんのんだ薬が効いてきたのではないか」というような解釈をする人があるのです。ところがお医者の方でなおったのはじき忘れるが、神様の方は、そういう理屈に合わないことは絶対に許されないのです。しかし、今までは和光同塵で、少しは許されてきたのですが、これからは絶対にお許しにならないのです。大本教のお筆先に「神厳しくなると人民穏かになるぞよ」というのがありますが、うまく言ってあります。それについてはっきり書きました。』 〔 御講話（S28年5月15日） 『御教え集』22号、昭和28(1953)年6月15日発行〕 『命にかかわらない病気ならそうでもないが、命にかかわるような病気がなおれば、命をいただいたのですから、なおってよいあんばいだと金儲けだとか相変わらずなことをしていると、せっかくくださった命を自分のことに利用してしまうことになるので、つまりいつも言うとおり、自分の命だと私有財産みたいに思ってしまうので、そこにたいへんなくい違いがあるのです。以前に、鉱山をやっている人で、そうとうに年をとった人ですが、心臓病で命のないところを助かったのです。それで自分は一生懸命に神様のために働くと口では言っているが、いつの間にか山に行って、しばらく見えないからどうしたかと思っていると、その人はそうとうの資本家で経営者であるから鉱山に行っていたが、具合が悪くなってあわてて帰ってきて、治療をしてもらうと良くなって、今度はよいだろうと思うと、また行ってしまうのです。そういうことがたびたびあったので、とうとう私は「あの人は駄目だから方っておけ」と言っておきましたが、それからしばらくして死んでしまいました。この人などはあんまり命を粗末にするのでもったいないくらいなものです。こういう人はめったにありませんが、これに似たようなことはよく聞きます。お蔭話などにもよく出てきますが、難病がなおって、そうして神様はたいしたものだと言いながら、この次再浄化で悪くなると医者に行くのです。そうしてさんざんやってもらって、今度は前よりも悪くなって、やっぱりこれは神様にすがろうと来る、それで今度なおると、そこで初めて分かるのです。実に世話がかかるのですが、よくそういう人があります。だからそういった大きなお蔭をいただいて命を助かった人は、これから大いに注意してやるのです。そうすれば再浄化はよほど少なくなります。そこで万一再浄化が起った場合には、なぜ起ったかという意味を、今のようなわけだということを話してやるとよいです。大体どんな病気でも、なおればそれよりか重い病気が起るわけはありません。第二の起り方ですから、軽くすむわけです。ところが再浄化の方がかえって重い場合が多いのです。ということは人間の方が間違っているからです。』 〔 御講話（S28年5月17日） 『御教え集』22号、昭和28(1953)年6月15日発行〕 『ですから再浄化もあるにはありますが、最初の病気よりも軽くすむわけなのです。一番最初、浄霊を受ける時が一番重くて、それがいったんなおるということは、それだけ一番大きな峠を越えたわけです。もしその次に再浄化が起るとすると、最初よりいくぶんか軽くなるのがあたりまえです。ところが軽くならないというところに、人間の間違いがあるわけです。』 〔 信仰の合理性と再浄化 『栄光』210号、昭和28(1953)年5月27日発行〕 『これによっても分るごとく、死を覚悟し絶望的となった重病患者が全治したとしたら、何を措（お）いても力の限り、神様に御恩報じをするのが当然であり、これが合理であるにかかわらず、忘れるとしたら御蔭の取りっ放しであり、恩知らずもはなはだしいのである。この理を一層分り易くいってみると、例えば生命の価値を十とすれば、十の感謝ならプラスマイナスであるが、十以上であればその余分だけはプラスになり、神様はその何倍にも当る御恵みを下さるものである。それと反対に感謝が五とすれば、差引五だけマイナスとなるから神様への借金となる。そこで一日も早く御返しすればいいが、それを怠（おこた）るとすると利息が嵩（かさ）んで借金は増えてゆく。この点現界と少しも変りはないので、これも相応の理である。そこで借金が溜ってある程度を越えると、神権裁判所から督促（とくそく）や差押えが来る。これが再浄化であるから、それに気が付き心からお詫びをすると共に、元利合計御払いすれば助かるのは当然である。』 ６ 御教えに反した行為の為お咎めを受けている場合 ① 夫婦の道 〔 御教え（S27年3月16日） 『御教え集』8号、昭和27(1952)年4月20日発行〕 「佐藤ひで子（十六歳）。小学校に入学の時身体検査で心臓弁膜症と言われ、運動を避けるように言われ、体操などは休んでおりましたが、通学には差し支えございませんでした。一年の時先天性心臓弁膜症にて治療方法も薬もぜんぜんないから、安静を保つようにと言われ、その通りにいたしましたが変化はございませんでした。昭和二十三年お道を知り、私（母）とひで子が入信させていただきました。翌月にわかに高熱が出、頭痛、腹痛があり、御浄霊させていただき、熱は下がり痛みも楽になり、平らな道は歩けるようになりましたが、少しの坂道でも息切れが激しく、歩行困難となり、顔、唇は紫色に変わります。最近特に激しく、平らな道でも右様になります。本年二月十一日にわかに全身が浮腫み、息切れ激しく、胸部より下腹部にかけて膨満はなはだしく、心臓背部に卵大の固結がございます。食欲はあまりなく、一日に茶碗二杯くらいでございます。小便は一日に四、五回ございますが、量は少ないようでございます。両頬、唇は紫色になり、手足は常に冷えております。私は後妻でございますが、先妻は心臓病で苦しみ、大正十三年三十三歳にて、産後二十二日目に死亡しております。子供は四人ございましたが、最初の子は生後三日目に、二番目は二十日目に他界し、三人目が現在御浄化をいただいております、ひで子でございます。四人目は生後三カ月目に急性肺炎で死亡いたしております。主人は反対はいたしませんが、入信する気持ちはなく、女道楽にて妾があるようでございます。ひで子の妊娠中医師より、先の子供が二人とも生後間もなく死亡しておりますので、サルバルサンを射つように言われ、六本射っております。この御浄化は霊的でございましょうか。御浄霊の急所につき御教示のほどお願い申し上げます。なお、光明如来様を御奉斎申し上ぐべくお願いいたしております。」 『これは、信仰雑話に書いてあるでしょう。不純な男女の罪は、子供の命に来るということは、信仰雑話にあるでしょう。その通りです。だから、婦人に対する不純関係ですね。その罪は子供に来るんだから、やっぱり、どうしても死にますよ、御主人が改心しなければね。そこで、現在のひで子というのも、やはりそれが関係してますから、浄霊しても治りが悪いんですよ。これは、光明如来様をお祀りして良くお願いするんです。そういった、いろんなややこしい罪穢をお許しを願って、そうして一家が天国になるように――そういうことをお願いする。そうして、ひで子という人の病気は、大体背中の固まりですね。これを溶かす。誰が浄霊しているんですか。』 「本人の母がいたしております。」 『そうしたら、力を入れないようにね。力を入れちゃ駄目ですよ。力をうんと抜けば、固まりが溶けますよ。これが溶ければ――これが因だから――大丈夫です。』 ② 人工流産 〔 御講話（S28年5月26日） 『御教え集』22号、昭和28(1953)年6月15日発行〕 『個人的間違いは秘しておくと書いてありますが、これがまたたいへんなことなのです。二番目の子供を産んで、七カ月くらいたった時にまた妊娠したのですが、そのくらいで妊娠すると前の子供が育たないということを人から聞いて、それを信じて堕胎したのです。今は妊娠中絶という体裁のよい言葉がついてますが、実は堕胎をしたのです。ですから母親に言ったのです。堕胎というのは殺人だ。わが子を殺すという子殺しの罪になるから、それも子供の病気に関係しているのだと言ってやりました。今朝か昨夜聞いたところによると、肺炎の子供は死んだそうです。ですからそれも大いに原因しているわけです。というのは、神様の方では、せっかく与えた子供を殺すということは、それではお前には子はいらないのだろうから、そういうのに与えた子供は、やはり召し上げるという理屈になるわけです。理屈に合わないことをすれば理屈に合わない結果になってしまいます。少なくとも信仰にはいっていながら堕胎などをするということは、とんでもない罪を犯したのです。それも、あとのやり方が理屈にあっていて、そうして非常に悔悟して、自分はとんでもない間違ったことをしたと言ってお詫びをすれば、あるいは助かったかもしれないが、そういうことも支部長はあんまり言わなかったらしいので、私がそう言ったらびっくりしてました。そうすると支部長のやり方がもっとも間違っていたのです。』 ③ 産後無理をした場合 〔 御教え（S27年2月27日） 『御教え集』7号、昭和27(1952)年3月20日発行〕 「高柳龍子（三年前入信。三十七歳）。昨年十二月四人目の出産をいたし、御守護により安産でありましたのと、従来の習慣にて、その日より便所に通いました。翌日の御教えに産後の御注意をいただきましたので、さっそくお伝えいたしましたが、たいして気にも止めない様子でございました。四日目に頭部に激痛を覚え、頭が割れるようで十日間続き軽くなりました。産後にもかかわらず腹部が膨脹し尿量も少なく、ついに全身に浮腫みを生じ、血痰を激しく吐き呼吸困難を起すようになりました。二回目の呼吸困難があり、御浄霊いただき楽になりましたが、全身的浮腫は取れません。三回目に及び、全身浮腫は以前よりはなはだしく、特に腹部はパンパンに膨れさがりました。一月末大光明如来様を御奉斎させていただきました。三カ月に及びますが、変化がございませんのは、御浄霊の急所が違っているのでございましょうか。また霊的に関係がございましょうか。なお、姑が入信後亡夫（金光教と禅宗の両方で祀っております）の慰霊のために、金光教会にお参りいたしましても差し支えございませんでしょうか。」 『これはいけないな。こんな習慣なんてありゃしないですよ。これは、この人の習慣ですよ。もっとも、ひとのみちの信者はやりますが、これは嘘ですよ。こういうことは以前から言ってありますがね。書いてありますがね。一週間は絶対便所に行ってはいけませんよ。頭が割れるよう――言うことを聞かないからだ。金光教会に――差し支えありませんよ。亡夫は信者だったんだからね。あるいは、まだ金光教に執着があるかもしれないからね。お詣りしても良し、しなくても良し、任意で良いですがね。これは霊的じゃない。たいして気に止めない――これは、その通りやらなかったんですか。』 「いたしておりませんようでございます。前三回が非常に楽なお産をいたしておりますために。」 『そのためです。そのお詫びですよ。それを本人が心からお詫びすれば、それで治りますよ。浄霊は結構だけれども、そのお咎めですよ。信者になった以上―― じゃない、メシヤ教の浄霊で救ってもらった以上――つまり私のやり方を言って、その通りやらなかったら救われっこないですね。だから、そのお詫びをするんです。頭に激痛――これは、祖霊さんが戒告したんです。それでも気がつかないんでお腹が膨脹したりしたんです。それで治るわけですがね。本人が心からお詫びしなければ駄目ですね。』 ④ 肉体にメスを用いた場合 〔 御教え（S26年10月15日） 『御教え集』3号、昭和26(1951)年11月3日発行〕 「袴田隆次（五十二歳）、昭和二十五年三月入信いたしました者でございます。長男浩司（十二歳）が九月十五日ごろ左足踵（かかと）の魚の目をメスにて疵（きず）をつけました。そのため二十日より急に発熱し、左足の大腿部がだいぶ腫れ、非常な激痛を感じ、脊柱はそりぎみになり、身体は硬直し痛みが強く、御浄霊後は小量の排尿がございました。脊柱のそりは一週間くらいにして治りましたが、熱は四十度くらい約二週間続き、食欲も皆無の状態にて非常に衰弱いたしましたが、お蔭様にて、最近十日ほど食欲はだいぶ旺盛となりましたが、その割に体力がつきません。最近は時々高熱を発し、特に両足（大腿部）に卵大の「しこり」があり、ちょっと触れても非常に痛がり、右足は曲げており、徐々に伸ばせば、伸びる程度でございます。一週間ほど前より咳の御浄化をいただき、激しい折は血痰も出ます。御浄霊をいただくたびに楽にさせていただいております。なお、八月中旬お墓におりました縞蛇を殺して食べたこともございます。また次女は八年前、脳脊髄膜炎にて死亡しておりますが、なにか霊的にも関係しているのでございましょうか。また御浄霊の箇所につき御教えのほどお願い申し上げます。御屏風観音様は今回奉斎させていただきました。」 『魚の目をメスにて疵をつけたというのは、切ろうとした。それで膿でも出そうとした。このためです。私は、針一本でも疵つけてはいけないと書いてあるでしょう。だから神様のお咎めです。お詫びが一番良い。他にはなにもないんです。それを覚るように正守護神がひどく叱ったんです。お詫びすれば治ります。つまり、神様のいうことを守らなかったからです。それを心から悔い改めて、お詫びして、それで治っていきます。そうして、あとは悪い所ですね。熱の高い所とか、悪い所から、出るんだから、固まりを――つまりこれだけの毒があるんだから、魚の目を浄霊していれば――気長にやっていれば、苦痛なく治るんです。こういうことをしたために苦痛が出るので、悪いことではないが、腫れた所とか、熱の出た所は分かりますから、そこを浄霊する。 体力がつかないのは、今まで食事をしなかったので、急にはいきません。それと、熱があるからで、あと気長にやれば良い。霊的のことはありません。蛇を食べたこともなんでもありません。脳脊髄膜炎も別になんでもありません。 神様は身体に疵をつけるということは非常に厳しい。ちょっと悪い時に切るとか、突くとかいうのは、霊を信じないことになる。体的を信ずることになる。食い違ってくる。御守護していたのが、パッと切れちゃう。そこにもっていって正守護神が怒りますからね。これは良い教えです。』 ７ 仏壇の祀り方 ① 幽世大神について 〔 御光話（S23年 6月28日） 『御光話録』発行年月日不明、推定昭和26年頃。〕 ――幽世大神とは閻魔大王のことでしょうか。 『ええ閻魔様です。幽世大神も観音様の部下なんですが、霊界で係りをやっているからお唱えするのです。ちょうどこの世でも区役所の仕事は内務省の管轄だが、いきなり内務大臣へは行かない。それと同様にそれぞれ係りがあるのです。』 ② 御屏風観音様を祀らすべく祖霊の戒告せる例 〔 御教え（S26年8月18日） 『御教え集』1号、昭和26(1951)年9月20日発行〕 「私の家は私始め二家七名入信の栄に浴し、御神体を奉斎、数々の御神徳をいただき歓喜敬神の誠を捧げております折、昨年三月入信の四女久（十九歳）が本年三月ごろより全身に微熱、倦怠、苦痛を覚え、旬日にして大浄化、発作を起しましたが御守護により一命を取り止めることができました。御守護御礼申し上げます。 娘久の病状は腰骨カリエスのごとき症状で脳天、延髄、脊髄の浄化激しく腹部の痛みがこれに次ぎます。チョイチョイある腹、胸の痛みは前記の場所の浄霊でよく治ります。脳天の痛む所はブヨブヨになっており、左延髄よりやや下がった所には小豆くらいの毒結あり、そこと延髄の近くの頭蓋骨のへりが最もよく発熱します。背中は筋肉が高く盛り上がって脊髄も非常に攣曲しておりましたが、このたびの御浄化で背中の形はスッカリ良くならせていただきました。 十四日より二十九日にかけて下腹部から喉に冷たい玉のようなものが上がってきて締めつけるような苦痛がございました。その折、伯母その他多勢の霊が仏壇から救いを求めるごとく出てまいり、振り離そうともがくうち、明主様の御姿が浮かび指で胸の辺りを指されたところ急に楽になってまいりました。それまでいろいろ支障あって屏風観音様をお祀りできませんでしたが、家内一同協議のうえお祀りいたしましたところ、すっかり霊的な苦痛はなくなりました。現在のところ食欲少なくだいぶ衰弱しており苦痛の程度は一進一退でございます。 信仰上また浄霊のうえで注意すべき点御教えのほどお願い申し上げます。」 『これは屏風観音様をお祭りしないので祖霊さんが催促したんです。それだけ（種々の症状）の後ですからね。食欲は少ないし、衰弱するのはしかたがないですね。腰骨カリエスですね。そうとうありますからね。これは、やっぱり祖先のメグリが、これで取れるんだから結構だ。 祖先も祭ってもらいたいし、それをお願いするという意味もありますね。ここ（前頭部）から、こう（後頭部）行く――いつか本にも書いたが。脳天にもいくらか固まっている。冷たい玉のようなものが――これは霊です。この人に憑いている霊ですね。お祀りいたしましたところ、霊的な苦痛はなくなりました――これも解決ついた。これは苦痛の所、そこだけ浄霊する。』 ③ 普通の観音様や仏壇に善言讃詞を奏げても無駄な事 〔 御光話（S23年 2月 8日） 『御光話録』発行年月日不明、推定昭和26年頃。〕 『ふつうの観音様や仏壇に善言讃詞を上げても駄目です。やむを得ないとき……例えば光明如来をいただこうとしているが、表装がまだできないときは別ですが。』 ④ 仏壇を階下に置いてよいか 〔 御光話（S24年11・12月） 『御光話録』16号、昭和25(1950)年1月20日発行〕 ――仏壇は階下にお祀りしてもよろしいでしょうか。 『これはいけませんね、絶対二階にお祀りすべきです。階下では人間のほうが上になってしまいますからね。』 ⑤ 祖霊祭りに就いての注意 〔 御講話（S26年10月18日） 『御教え集』3号、昭和26(1951)年11月3日発行〕 『よく、宗教を替わった場合に、特に神道ですが、神道に祀るのが良いとして、また先生にもそういう風に勧められますが、それが、祖霊にとっては非常にありがた迷惑なんです。それを霊が出て言うんですから、一番はっきりしているんですが、以前から私が、やたらに改宗してはいけない。一軒の家族でも、揃って改宗する事は滅多にないんですからね。ところが、やっぱり祖霊さんでも同じ事で、天理教の信者になっても、俺は嫌だ。昔からの仏界の方が良いと言う祖霊の方が多いですから、それを気づかせようと思って、天理教に入ってから、重い病気になったり、苦しんだりすると言うのは、そう言う訳なんです。また、キリスト教に入って先祖を祀らなくて良いと、祖霊を祀るのをやめますが、祖霊は悲しんだり怒ったりします。ところがメシヤ教は違います。信者になったというだけでも喜びますから、不賛成と言うものはないんです。これは霊が憑ってよく言います。それでも中にはこういうのがあります。御嶽教、豊川さんと、いろんなのがありますが、そう言うので、役員になったりしたのが、霊界に行ったのは、メシヤ教は良い宗教には違いないが、癪に障ってしょうがない。邪魔してやれと言うのがいる。また狐が憑って邪魔する場合もありますからね。 すぐに祀り替えや、そう言う事はしないようにして以前通り祀ってやって、何年か経ってから、メシヤ教が分かって来るから、ぜひ祀られたいと言う気分が起こってきますから、これが一番安全なんです。稲荷なんかそうですね。狐ですから、悪い方が多いが、メシヤ教と言うと、とんでもない。邪魔してやれと言うのがいる。この間の地上天国の質問応答に、そう言うのがありました。これは先生が知らないんですが要するに指導者の失敗ですね。光明如来様をお祭りするや否やすぐに処分してしまった。それで狐が怒って――と言うのがあった。それで処理の仕方が早かった。という事を答えた。そんな訳で祖霊さんを祀り替えるという時も、慎重にしなければならないという生きた実例なんです。』 附 祖霊祭りに就いての注意 〔 御光話（S23年 2月18日） 『御光話録』発行年月日不明、推定昭和26年頃。〕 『神道では神さえ祀れば仏はどうでもよいとしているがこれはいけない。特にキリスト教は先祖を祀らないから不幸です。病人や死人がよけい出ます。山室軍平なんかはいい人でしたが不幸だったですね。実に哀れです。祖先を祀らないから祖先が怒るんです。西洋は霊界も東洋と違っており、また生きているときからそういうふうに教育されているからかまわないが、東洋の霊界は縦で層をなしています。西洋は横です。』 ――最近、家族制度が変化しましたが霊界も変わるでしょうか。 『家族制度が変わってもたいしたことはない。いままでは家長が一人でいばっていた。これは間違いですよ。』 ⑥ 御屏風観音様の御奉斎の位置は上段にし、先祖とそれ以下の位牌は中段以下にする事 〔 御垂示（S28年5月1日） 『御垂示録』20号、昭和28(1953)年5月15日発行〕 「御屏風観音様が動くのは祖霊の戒告でしょうか」 『動くとはどういうのですか。』 「台からはみ出します」 『はみ出てはいけません。』 「一度直しましたが、三時間ほどしますと、またなります」 『自動的に動くのですか。それは何か間違っているのです。今度仏壇を前から見た図を書いて来なさい、見てあげます。話でも分かればよいですが――。仏壇は何段になってますか。』 「三段で、その上に台をおいて御屏風観音様を御奉斎しております」 『台は必要ないでしょう。三段の一番上に戒名があるのでしょう。』 「横に戒名があります」 『上の段には戒名を祀ってはいけません。戒名は下の二段にお祀りするのです。それが間違っているのです。そうすると御先祖様が苦しいのです。つまり同列になるから苦しいのです。それは台くらいの違いではいけません。だから御先祖様が知らせるのです。やっぱり霊界ですから上中下となっているのですから、観音様は上段で、御先祖以下は中段以下にならなければなりません。観音様と同じ段では苦しいのです。』 「十光中教会の鈴木でございます。ただ今のことにつきまして、人が立ちますと仏壇より高くなりますので、その関係ではないかと思いましたが」 『それも面白くないです。しかしその関係ばかりではないので、今の三段のほうです。立っているときは高くても、お参りするときには人間のほうが低くなりますから、そう大きな御無礼ではありませんが、三段のことは絶対にいけません。仏壇の中は一つの霊界で、たいへんに大きな極楽界ですから、その順序がちょっとでも違ったらたいへんです。それから人間が立ってそれより低いというのは、非常に悪いわけではないのです。そういう家はたくさんあります。だからなるべくなら仏様が上のほうが結構ですが、しかし人間が立った上だと、仏様はばかに上になってしまします。座ると、かえって仏様は見えなくなります。ですからそこは臨機応変にやることです。』 「私がお取次ぎして、御屏風観音様に台をして、同じ段に先祖代々の霊を祀らせました。お詫び申し上げます」 『それはいけません。』 ⑦ 霊界では順序が厳格であり祖霊は順序正しく居並ぷ事 〔 御講話（S28年9月5日） 『御教え集』26号、昭和28(1953)年10月15日発行〕 『霊界はでたらめではないので、実に厳格になってますから、霊主体従の法則によって、順序が違っているとそれだけ影響がきますから、苦しかったり思うようにゆかなかったり、なんだか気持ちが悪いものです。ですから、私がこうして高い所でしゃべるから、しゃべりよいし、またあなた方も聞きよいのですが、これが逆になったら変なものです。ですから「神は順序なり」で、神様は非常に順序がやかましいのです。仏様を拝むたびに祖霊がたくさん来ますが、それは実に順序がキチンとしています。大先祖は上段にいて、それからだんだん新しい先祖ほど下にゆき、親子兄弟、親戚と、その順序は正確に並んでいるわけです。』 ⑧ 真中が最上座 〔 御垂示（S26年12月8日） 『御垂示録』5号、昭和26(1951)年12月25日発行〕 「先祖を真中にした場合に、主人の父母の位牌を別々にした場合は、向って右が上座なので、父は先祖に近いほうに――」 『真中が一番上座でしょう。真中に寄ったほうが上座にすれば良い。その場合は、右左は関係ない何でも左が上だと言って、左にするとおかしいものになっちゃう。下座上座がないような場合は左が上座になる。そうでないのは、そういった――真中を上座にする。私がここにいて、左が上座と言うと、あっちに行っちゃう。格好が悪い。』 ⑨ 後列が上座 〔 御垂示（ S27年2月**日) 『御垂示録』7号、昭和27(1952)年3月10日発行〕 「仏壇の同じ段の場合は、前列と後列は、どちらが上座になるのでございましょうか」 『後列ですよ。』 ⑩ 御祭りは早くしても遅くしてはいけない事 〔 御光話（S23年 5月18日） 『御光話録』発行年月日不明、推定昭和26年頃。〕 ――毎月十八日のお観音様の日にお祀りできない場合は―― 『十七日にしたらよい。神仏のお祀りや法事なぞは早くするのはよいが遅れるのはいけない。』 ⑪ 分骨はいけない事 〔 御光話（S24年7月特輯号） 『御光話録』9号、昭和24(1949)年7月30日発行〕 ――新仏の骨を埋葬する場合、祖先の墓と家の近くと二カ所に分骨したいと存じますがこれはよろしいでしょうか。 『骨を分けるってのはいけません。髪の毛や爪なら分けるってことをしますがね、骨はいけませんよ。これは祖先の墓にまとめて埋葬すればいいですよ。』 ⑫ 分骨してあるのは 〔 御光話（S24年 4月23日） 『御光話録』7号、昭和24(1949)年**月**日発行〕 ――分骨はいけないとのお言葉でしたが、すでに分骨してしまったのはいかがいたすべきでしょうか。 『してしまったのは、それでいいですよ。ただ霊は嫌いますがね、霊じゃ骨をどうするってこともできませんからね。』 ８ 信仰の狂い 〔 御講話（S28年5月25日） 『御教え集』22号、昭和28(1953)年6月15日発行〕 『ついでに話しますが、以前ある人で、支部長ではあるが、将来中教会長になりそうな支部長で、その人は肺病かなにかがなおって入信したのです。再浄化が起って、それもたいした難しいものではありませんが、あんまり酷いから私も助けてやろうと思ってしてやりましたが、その時叔父さんかなにかが持っている支那陶器を、お気に入るか入らない物か見ていただきたいと言うのです。しかし腹の中ではどうも買ってもらいたいかで、スーッとした話ではないのです。それで、見たところが良い物ではないので、値打ちにして二、三万くらいな物です。金を出して買うのはいやだが、もらうのならもらってもよいというくらいの物です。それを言ったところが、ではと言って叔父さんの所に持って帰ったのです。本当の誠があれば、それでもぜひ差し上げたいと言うのが本当ですが、それを神様を陶器の鑑定家扱いにしてしまったのです。私はそれで、これはいけないと思ったのです。この一点でぜんぜん駄目です。明主様がお気に入った物なら、ぜひ差し上げるというのが本当ですが、そういう態度ではないのです。それから少しやってやりましたが、だんだん悪くなって、そのことがありますから、これはいけないと話してやりましたが、死んでしまいました。そういうようで、ちょっとしたことで、その人の想念と信仰の程度というものが分かります。この想念というものは徹底しなければなりません。そこにちょっとでも曇りのようなものがあっては、お蔭はいただけません。それも半年や一年ではそこまで行きませんが、もう何年もやっていて、そこまで徹底しないというのはいけません。今の話も、支部長なり中教会長なりがそういった理屈が分かっていないというところに、具合の悪い、おもしろくないところがあります。とにかく病気をなおすとか、その人を救うということは、ただその人を健康にするだけではないのです。健康にするとともに、立派な人間にするということが最後の目的ですから、ただ体が丈夫になって働くというだけでは人類は救えません。つまり霊肉ともに健康な人間にしなければならないということが根本です。』 ９ 信仰の合理性について １ 救いと律法との関係 〔 御講話（S28年5月26日） 『御教え集』22号、昭和28(1953)年6月15日発行〕 『神様は愛ですが、理屈に合わなければ神様はどうしようもないのです。神様は御利益をいくらでも与えたいのです。ところが資格がないのです。たとえてみれば金銭にしても、神様はいくらでもザルなり財布なりに入れてあげたいのですが、この財布の中に汚いものがあるから入れられないのです。それを掃除すればよいのです。ですから人間の方で命を助かりたい時には、人間の方で助かる状態にすればよいのです。それをしてないから、神様の方にも規則がありますから、神様自身がその規則を外すことはできないから、助けたくても助けられないということになります。』 ２ 神様に対して順序を尊ぶべき事 １ 〔 御光話（S24年 3月 8日） 『御光話録』5号、昭和24(1949)年＊月＊日発行〕 ――ではお道、順序ということは固く言うべきでしょうか。 『ええ、言わなければいけません。理の立つことなら言っていいんです。』 ① 頭を下げてお願いせぬ人は浄霊をする必要のない事 『それから私は家内なんかに対してもそうなんですが、先方で浄霊をしてくれというとき以外はしてやらないのです。その代わりしてくれと言えば夜いったん寝てからでもまた起きてしてやります。』 ② 出掛けて行って浄霊を押売せぬ事 『神様にお願いするんでも足を運ぶべきです。だからこっちから押しかけて行って押し売りするのはいけないのです。希望もしないのに無理にするのは神様と人間との位置が転倒してしまうのです。』 ③ 御浄霊をお願いする時お玉串をお供えする事 『またこういうことがあります。「この病気が治ったら御礼をする」と言う人がありますが、これも反対で、これでは神様が下になってしまうのです。つまり、神様のほうで治させていただいて御礼をいただくということになるのです。（笑声）天理教は上げることをさかんに言うが、天理教自身に力がないため病気などが治らずそのため一種の詐欺になるんですが、これは神様が悪いのではなく、取り次ぎする人が効かないのに効くと人に言うから悪いのです。だからもし効かなかったらその金を返せばいいんです。で治らなくてかけ合ったりする話をよく聞きますが、しかし順序から言えばそれが本当で、神様のほうを主にすべきです。……親切はどこまでも親切にすべきです。実際問題としてはそうどこまでも親切にはできないが、事情の許す限り親切にすべきですね。』 ④ 御参詣の途中寄道をした人は出直す事 ――用達をしてから教導所へ来る人には出直して来なければしてやらない、という方もありますが…… 『それが本当です。お詣りに来るのは一番先にすべきであって用達をしてから来たんでは効果が少ない。だからそれではつまらないですよ。やはり神様のことが主なんだから、主となることと従となることとははっきりしなければいけないのです。』 〔 御垂示（S29年3月1日） 『御垂示録』29号、昭和29(1954)年3月15日発行〕 『一切はそうなってます。一番先に行く所が主になるのです。その次の所は従になるわけです。ついでになるわけです。だから仮に、こういうことなのです。個々に会う、人も、事柄もそうですが、特に神様のことはそうです。最初神様にお参りに行って、それからは何の用をしても構わないのです。ところが他の用を先にして神様のお参りを後にすると、順序が違っているから決してうまくゆかないです。物事も順調にゆかないです。だから主と次のこととは、はっきりしなければいけないです。そうするとうまくゆくのです。』 ２ 〔 御講話（S28年5月27日） 『御教え集』22号、昭和28(1953)年6月15日発行〕 『それからこの前「信仰は理屈に合わなければいけない」ということを言いましたが、それに関連したことがありましたから、そのことを書きましたから、今読ませますが、つまり浄霊の場合に、今まで、でたらめが多かったのです。そのでたらめでは、そこに理屈に合わないと、骨を折ってそれだけの効果がないのです。それにちょうどよい例がありましたから、今読ませます。』 （御論文「 信仰の合理性に就いて 」）【栄光 二一三号】 ① 頭を下げて御願いせぬ人は御浄霊する必要のない事 『つまり浄霊でも、でたらめではあんまり効かないのです。それですから私なども、ふだん家内などがどんなに苦しんでいても、決して向こうでやってもらいたいと頼むまでは、絶対にやってやらないのです。「ここが苦しいから」「ここが痛いからやっていただきたい」と言えばよいですが、人間というものは変なもので、謎をかけるのです。「ああここが気持ちが悪い」とか「ここが苦しい」と言うのですが、私は知らん顔をしているのです。向こうが頭を下げるまではやらないのです。それはべつに、意地が悪いのでもなんでもないのです。そうでなければなおりが悪いのです。一番悪いのはよく押し売りをします。「さあやってやろう」と言ってやりますが、それがいけないのです。もっとも赤ん坊は別ですが、分別がある以上は、先方がお願いすると言ってからでないと、やっても効果がないのです。ですからそれをよく心得ておかなければならないのです。ちょうどなにかの場合に、御利益をいただきたいと神社仏閣に行って、どうかお助けいただきたいと言うのなら御利益をいただけるのです。それをその辺をボヤボヤと行ったり来たりしていれば、なにをしている、と神様だって横を向かれます。というのは、人間と神様の地位に高下のあることを忘れてはいけないのです。』 ② 御浄霊を御願いする前にお玉串を捧ぐべき事 『それから「なおしてやるから御礼しろ」とか、また「なおったら信仰にはいらしてもらう」というのならよいですが、「なおったら信仰にはいってやる」というのは、どっちが上だか分からないことになります。大体、なおったら御礼するということも、今までは神様を傭って使うようなもので、賃金をやるようなものです。これだけの仕事をするから、これだけの賃金をやろう、ということでは神様だって横を向かれます。そこがなかなか難しいのです。また、あんまり御利益のないのに金を上げろというのもいけないことです。前に、天理教の教師で、病気で苦しんでいる時に、いくらいくら金を上げれば助かるということをよく言うのです。それで、そのいくらいくらを上げるのですが、なおらないで死んでしまうことがありますが、私は、それでは神様がやっているのではなくて、神様の取り次ぎ者が詐欺をやっている、とよく言ったことがありますが、これは御利益があって、本当にありがたいという感謝の気持ちで上げるのが本当のことで、受け売り仕事でさせるのはいけないのです。しかしまた、それだけの御利益があり、命まで助けてもらいながら、それを忘れたり、よけいなつまらない金にはウンと使って、御礼の方には少しばかり上げるということも理屈に合いません。ですからこの前も言ったとおり、理屈に合わなければいけないということです。』 附 浄霊を厭がる子供 〔 御垂示（S27年3月1日） 『御垂示録』8号、昭和27(1952)年4月25日発行〕 「母親が産婆で、四つくらいの女の子が御浄霊を嫌がり、暴れますので、風邪を引いていたのを押えていたしました。しばらくして肺炎のようになり、御浄霊は非常に嫌がります。実家が日蓮宗でございます。産婆さんは入信いたしておりますが、今でも日蓮宗を拝んでおります。子供が御浄霊を嫌うのはそういう関係でございましょうか」 『そうですよ。日蓮宗の狐が憑いているんですよ。苦しいからね。だからよしたら良い。だいたい押えつけてやるというのは嘘ですよ。神様のほうでは、嫌がるのを、押えつけてやるのは、とんでもない間違いですよ。よしたほうが良い。産婆さんが、信仰に入って日蓮宗を拝んでいるならよしたほうが良い。』 「前に子供が救われましたので――」 『それでも解らないんだから、やる必要はない。かえって神様に御無礼です。だから、それをやったメシヤ教の教師が、今まで間違ったことをして申しわけないとお詫びしなさい。日蓮宗をよすから救ってもらいたいというのなら御浄霊してあげてよろしい。』 「最近手紙で解りましたので――」 『聞いたらすぐ、よせと言ってやると良い。』 ３ 御浄霊を頂く方の想念 〔 御講話（S28年12月5日） 『御教え集』29号、昭和29(1954)年1月15日発行〕 『順序というものは、やはり理屈に合うことです。合理的なものです。だからその病人なら病人が、まだいろいろ反対者があったり、その人の想念がおそろしく食い違ったりするときにはうまくゆかないのです。そのうまくゆかないというところにまた一つの理由があるのです。それは、その病人がなにも分からないうちは疑いもし、反対もし、物は試しだぐらいにやるのですが、それはそれで神様から許されます。それはあたりまえです。ところがそうとうに話を聞いたり、御神書を読んだり、中には信仰に入ったりする人がありますが、入っていながら、それに合ってゆかない想念でやってもらうと、その時は治りが悪いのです。うまくゆかないのです。そういうことに対してチャンと合理的の理屈があるのです。だからかえって疑ぐっていた人が馬鹿に治り、それからそうとうに信じている人で治りが悪いということがありますが、それはそういうわけです。ぜんぜん知らない人はいくら疑ぐっても、それはあたりまえのことで許されるのです。理屈に合っているのです。ところがそうとう事実を見せられながら、なお疑ぐっている人は思うようにゆかないのです。そういうことをよく考えてみると、チャンと理屈に合っているわけです。その合っている理屈を早く発見し、早く知るということが智慧証覚です。心の鏡に写るわけです。ですから鏡が曇ると写りが悪いから、始終鏡を磨いているとよく写るから、早く発見するということになるのです。ここに信仰の、案外軽く見ていることで、実は非常に重要な点があります。』 ４ 原則として家族が浄霊する事 〔 御講話（S28年5月27日） 『御教え集』22号、昭和28(1953)年6月15日発行〕 『ですから今の支部長に浄霊をやってもらうということも、ぜんぜんいけないことではないのですが、それはごく苦しい時とか、病気が分からない時は支部長に聞いて浄霊してもらえばよいですが、そうでなくて、自分でやればよいのを支部長の手数をかけるというのは間違っています。それも病気によっていろいろありますが、肺炎というのは、ほったらかしておいてもなおるくらいですから、父親か母親がやればそれで結構なおるのです。それを早いうちから支部長に頼むとなおりが悪いのです。かえって父親や母親がやる方が、より早くなおります。というのは、支部長というものは多くの人を助け、御神業を発展させるということの考えでいるべきであって、そこが外れているから、骨折りながらうまく行かないというわけです。ですから、ただむちゃくちゃに浄霊してもいけないので、そこに筋が立たなければいけないのです。「神は順序なり」と言うから、その筋を立ててやれば、割合楽になおるのです。そういうことは今まで割合に話しませんから、そういう間違ったことが起るわけです。これは肝腎なことですから、今話したわけです。』 〔 御講話（S28年5月25日） 『御教え集』22号、昭和28(1953)年6月15日発行〕 『病気の時に、一々支部長を煩わせるということがたいへんな間違いだということを知らしたのです。大体自分の家族は自分が浄霊する以上、他人を浄霊して信者にするということが本当ですから、小児麻痺というようなのなら、支部長とか古い幹部に頼むということもありますが、肺炎くらいは方っておいてもなおるくらいのものです。それを支部長を煩わせるということは、一度か二度ならまだしも、今年の二月から五カ月も支部長が行くということは、支部長もどうかしているし、片方も信者になってから二年くらいたっているのですが、どうかしてます。これではしようがないので、うまくなおるはずがありません。だから浄霊者も、風邪引きとか腹下しくらいはなんでもないが、少しグズグズしてなおらないということは、必ずなにかがあるのですから、それを発見してお詫びをするのです。お詫びをすると、それだけで浄霊しなくてもなおってしまいます。そういうことで、でたらめなことがあんがい多いのです。それでこういう注意を書いたのです。そういうことに気がつくということも、その人の智慧証覚が進んでいればすぐ気がつきます。つまり智慧証覚でそういう急所を発見しないと無駄なことをし、骨折って結果が悪いということになります。そういう場合、ちょっとしたことでも、それが非常に影響するのです。』 ５ 御教書のお取扱い 〔 御講話（S28年3月15日） 『御教え集』20号、昭和28(1953)年4月15日発行〕 『今度のお蔭話で、栄光に出しますが、そういうようなことに関して九州の坂井さんの話ですが、いろいろな例があります。病気で、浄霊でどうもうまくいかない、それで気がつくと、私の書いたものとか栄光新聞というものを調べると、ふつうの日刊新聞の下にあったり、はさまったりしているので、これだなと思ってとると、病人が良くなるというので、実にはっきりしているのです。 それから私の書いたものですが、これはまた凄いのです。その上にほかの物がのっていたりすると、とてもわけの分からない苦しみがあるのです。昔、私が宝山荘にいる時分に、その部屋がどうも気持ちが悪いのです。私も気持ちが悪いし、誰でもがそうなのです。それでその部屋に行くと、みんな病気みたいになるのです。それでおかしいと思ったが、どうも分からないのです。ところがほかの人からもらった、ふつうの人間が書いた色紙が柱掛けにかかっていたのです。それで気がついて、それをとってみると、その裏に私の色紙がはいっていたので、これだなと思ってそれを外したら、それですっとしたのです。今度のお蔭話にいろいろ書いてありますから読めば分かりますが、これは大いに注意することです。それで病気になって幾日もなおらないのですが、分かってみると、すぐなおってしまうのです。よく子供の病気などであります。それはなにかというと、順序が違うからです。ですから私は家にいても栄光新聞は決して下におきません。それから私の書いたものとか写真は決して下におきません。それは人ばかりでなく、私自身もなんだか気持ちが悪いのです。ですから順序くらい軽くみることができないものはありません。』 10 取次者の霊力の強弱について １ 霊力の強弱と取次者の人格の関係 〔 神智の光（地上天国18号） 、昭和25(1950)年11月25日発行〕 「（一）お道にある人で、治病力がすばらしいのですが、どうしたことか、人格的にも、常識的にも優れていないと見受けられる節がよくあります。治病力が強いということは、その人の魂が清まっている証左であるとすれば、必ず人格的にも豊かであるはずです。 このような場合、治病率は人格のバロメーターとなり得るでしょうか。不遜ながらお伺いいたします。 （二）私どもは、初め善いと思って行動したことが、結果において悪を招いてしまうことがしばしばあります。私どもの行動判断の規準はなにに求むべきでしょうか。」 『（一）これは難しい問題で、一口には言えない。古い人と新しい人では、治病力が違う。また上面ではよい人に見えるが、心が悪い人もある。上面は善く見えなくても、心に誠の強い人もある。また治病力の多かった人でも慢心したり、取り違いしたりして薄くなる人もある。またその人の手柄によって神様からお蔭をいただく人もあり、よく見える人でも手柄のない人は御守護が薄い。 要するに、結果から見て、功績のある人は神様から力を与えられるが、立派に見えても功績のない人はその反対である。結局、人間の目で見ては判らない。心の底は神様よりほかに判るはずはないと思う人は、神様が判った人である。 （二）それは小乗の善だからである。どうしても大乗の善でなくては、結果はよくない。この大乗小乗の意味は、御神書の随所に書いてあるから充分読みなさい。』 ２ 気魄、気力と霊力の関係 〔 妙智之光（地上天国８号） 、昭和24(1949)年9月25日発行〕 「気迫、気力などの強い人のほうが御浄霊の効果が多いかに見受けられますが、いかがでしょうか。」 『気迫と気力の強い人はよく治るし急所がよく見える。つまり頭がいいのである。』 ３ 想念の持ち方及びその他の諸条件 〔 御垂示（S28年7月1日） 『御垂示録』22号、昭和28(1953)年7月15日発行〕 『どの病気でもそうですが、浄霊の霊力の強い弱いによって治る治らないということがあります。その霊力というのは力を抜くほど強くなるのです。ですから力を抜くことが大事です。本当に力が抜けるようになったらたいしたものです。あとはその人の信仰の深さによって霊力が強くなります。ということは智慧証覚が根本です。それから一つ注意しておくことは、慢心すると霊力はずっと少なくなります。だから信仰にはいりたてで「自分なんかに、そんな、できやしない」とビクビクしているときには割に治るのです。「もうオレはできて来た」と思うようになると治りません。それはなぜかというと慢心だからです。だからオッカナビックリの気持でやると治るのです。そうかと言ってビクビクしてやるのがよいわけではないので、つまり大いに神様の道具にならせていただいたという謙遜です。気持は、相手の病人は虫ケラほどでもないが、ごくつまらない人だというように思わなくてはならないのです。これは偉い人だと思うと、こっちの霊力が負けてしまいます。救世教は他の宗教から見るとまるで桁が違っているのです。その力をいただいているとしたら、世の中の人間は虫ケラのようなものです。しかしそれを出してはいけません。こっちは大いに謙遜しているのです。そこが難しいと言えば難しいです。』 ４ 霊統、智慧証覚、想念との関係 〔 御光話（S24年 7月23日） 『御光話録』13号、昭和24(1949)年10月21日発行〕 ――同じように御光りをいただいてても、人によりその御力に格段の相違があるように存じますがこれはどういうわけでしょうか。 『まったくね、浄霊する人によってたいへんな違いがありますからね。……これは結局霊力の強さによるんですが、長く、そして数多くやってる人は強いんです。一、二年やってもどうにもならない病人を、私が二、三度やると治ってしまいますからね。それくらい人によって違う……まあ、違うのがあたりまえですがね……（笑声） で、この霊力が違ってくるのにはいろいろ原因がありますが、第一は、日本人には三種の系統があるんです。本当の日本人である大和民族と朝鮮系と支那系のこの三つですね。そしていわゆる日本人の中で一番多いのは支那系で、これは百人のうち六十人くらい、朝鮮系は三十人くらい、それから十人くらいが日本人です。だから本当の大和民族はごく少ないんです。ま、多く見て十分の一でしょうね。これは霊統ですよ、血統のほうはいろいろ混りますが、霊統は混りながらもちゃんと繋がっているんです。それで、日本人の霊統の人が浄霊すると非常に力が強くてとてもよく治るんです。それから朝鮮、支那の順ですね。しかし、この区別はちょっと判りませんよ、顔を見たって判らないし、名前でも判りませんしね。 次はその人の心ですよ。この信仰に入って「なるほど、これは非常にいいことだ、世の中の人はまったく地獄に苦しんでいる。これを一人でも多く助けなくちゃいけない」っていう心の人はどうしても治りがいいし、「まあまあ信仰して御利益をいただいて、安楽に暮せりゃそれでいい」なんて思ってる人はそれほど力が強くなく、やっぱり治りが悪いですよ。 それからまた、これは生まれつきだからどうにもならないけど、よく言う「きかない気」の人は治りがいいですね。 しかし、どうしたって誠の多い人ですよ。本当に気の毒でたまらないから治してあげようって人は治りが一番いいですよ。この人を治したら金がうんと入るとか、出世するとか、勢力を得るとかいう気持ちでやると、ちょっと治りがよさそうに見えても、結局はあまりよくないですね。やっぱり、その人の心通りになるんですからね。心が神様の御心に合っている人は、なんと言っても御守護も強く、力もまた強いもんですよ。心持ちしだいで同じ霊線が来ても、その人の体を通るときに違ってきてしまうんです。きれいな水でも濁った所を通ればやっぱり濁ってしまうし、濁ってない所を通れば、どうしても水がきれいなのと同じでね、そんなもんですよ。 それから、根本から言うと「覚り」っていうこともあるんです。信仰の深いことが判ってくると、霊力も従って強くなります。勿論、深いと言ってもどこまでも深いものなんですがね。ちょうど、ピラミッドのようなもんですよ。（お煙草二本で∧の形をお示しくださる）この辺が（図略）ふつうに活動している人の程度ですが、この辺（図略）になると霊的に位がついてきて、霊力がずっと違ってくるんです。もう、この辺（図略）から上になると神秘が判るんで「見真実」となるんですが、一番上は主神で、ここになるともう判らぬものはなにもないんです。お釈迦は、まあこの辺（図略）だったんですが、この一番上まで上った人は未だだれもいないんですよ……』 参考 専門家に御浄霊頂く様御教え頂いた例 〔 御教え（S27年3月7日） 『御教え集』8号、昭和27(1952)年4月20日発行〕 「曳野清野（昨年十一月入信。三十歳）。五年前湿性肋膜炎にて、少量の排水とカルシウム注射十五本で、一時良くなっておりましたが、昨年風邪が因で再発し、肺結核と言われ、絶対安静をいたしパス十日分服用いたし、そのころより御浄霊をいただくようになり、一時たいへん良くなり外出もできるようになりました。本年二月再浄化をいただき、吐痰激しく、食も進まず衰弱してまいりました。発熱はあまりありませんが、激しい咳と多量の喀痰にかなり苦しんでおります。喉頭に痛みを感じ、声も出ず、食事もできかねますが、咽喉が乾くと言い、水はかなり飲みます。盗汗や痔も出ますが、衰弱はほとんどその極に達した感がございます。兄は喉頭結核で、母は胃癌で死亡しております。御屏風観音様はお祀りさせていただいておりますが、御神体はまだでございます。御浄霊の急所につき御教示のほどお願い申し上げます。」

危険な時は生命の執着を取るべき事 １ 〔 御講話（S28年6月25日） 『御教え集』23号、昭和28(1953)年7月15日発行〕 『それから私は前から言おうと思ってはいましたが、これで気がついたので言います。重病の場合でもう治る見込みがないという時に「どんなになっても、まだそんな失望するにあたらないから、しっかりしていろ」と言って慰めますが、これは本当言うといけません。やはり生の執着が御守護の邪魔をするのです。治すのは、正守護神が神様の方から力をいただいて、自分がお取り次ぎして治すのですが、その場合に生の執着があると、正守護神の思うとおりにならないのです。本人や周囲の者の執着心が邪魔するので、治る場合も治らないということも大いにあります。ですからこれからは、もう駄目だと思ったら、早く本人に諦めさせるのです。「これはもう駄目だ、死ぬ覚悟をしなさい」と言った方が、かえって助かるのです。 このことは私も経験がありますが、私は二十八の時にチフスをし、自分でもとても助かるとは思えないので遺言をしたのです。それは前の家内の時で、当時小間物屋だったが、「自分はもう駄目だから、自分が死んだら商売は誰々に任して、こういうようにしろ」と言ったくらいですから、ぜんぜん生の執着が取れたのです。それで知っている人の兄が医学博士で、病院が近くにあるのでそこに頼んだのです。そうするとその医者が来て診た結果、これは入院しても助かる見込みはない。助かる見込みのない者をみすみす入れるということは、病院の信用を落とすからお断りすると断られたのです。ところがそのころの私の家は狭くて、起居する部屋は二部屋しかないので、もしもの時に大勢人が来ても狭いから、死んでもよいから入院させてくれと、院長の弟が友達だったからその方から頼んで、やっとはいったのです。それでその当時は自動車はなくて人力車でしたが、人力車にも乗れなかったので、担架に乗って担いでもらって行ったのです。そして寝ながら町を歩いている人を見て、これで人を見るのも見おさめだと思ったのです。そうしたら夢とも現（うつつ）ともなく墓場が見えてしようがなかったのです。それで自分は駄目だとよけい思われました。しかしどうやら息はつながっているのです。そうして非常に強い薬で、この薬が効かなければもう駄目だと言われたが、それをのまされるとその苦しいの苦しくないの、実に苦しかったです。それでも死なずにいました。そこで係の医者が、最初の見立ては肺炎だというのですが、その医者は肺炎とは思えない、チフスと思うから試験してみようというので、発泡薬というのでツユを取るのですが、ツユを取って顕微鏡で見たら、確かにチフスだということで、チフスの手当てをしなければならないということになったのです。チフスは絶対流動物であって、チフスには薬はないのです。それから絶対流動物で、だんだんよくなって治ったのです。そういうようで、生の執着を取ったことがよかったのです。 それには本人が肝腎なのです。本人に「あなたはもう駄目だから諦めなさい」と言い渡した方がよいです。それから本人ばかりでなく、親や周囲の近親者も大事なのです。近親者の執着の霊が邪魔します。ですから霊の邪魔というのが非常に重大なのです。それはそれとして、家の中に非常に反対している者がある場合に、反対している者は「もしか治ると自分が恥をかいたりするから、どうしても治らないように」と一生懸命に思うその霊がまた非常に邪魔をするのです。そこで、執着はなんにでもいけませんが、執着はどこまでも逆効果になるということを心得ておかなければいけません。』 附 〔 御講話（S28年6月27日） 『御教え集』23号、昭和28(1953)年7月15日発行〕 『また家族の者が「どうか助けたい」というその執着が、やっぱり邪魔します。それからさらにまた家族の者に信仰に反対の者がいる場合に、もし治ると自分の面目がつぶれますから、どうしても助からないようにしたいという執着は一番恐ろしいです。これは一番悪性です。治らないようにする執着ですから一番悪いのです。ですから家族に反対者があった場合には結果が悪いのはそういうわけです。だからなにごとも執着が非常に災いするのです。』 ２ 〔 御講話（S28年6月27日） 『御教え集』23号、昭和28(1953)年7月15日発行〕 （御論文「 超奇蹟 」）【栄光 二一八号】 『今読んだとおりですが、陰茎の方は、三分の一くらいを手術で切って元通りに伸びたということは以前聞いたことがありますが、睾丸が取れて元通りになったということは実に奇蹟以上です。よく昔から「睾丸を一つつぶせば命はない」と言われてますが、金玉一つどころでなく二つともなくなったのです。それで生きているだけでなく元通りになったのですから、どう考えても分からないことです。ですからこれは世界的問題として大いに人類に知らせる必要があると思います。このことは神様の方ではチャンと分かります。しかしこれを説明したところで、あまりに神秘でちょっと信じられないというかも分かりません。いずれ時期が来たらこういう説明もしますが、今のところは致し方ないわけです。 それでこういう場合に一番肝腎なことは執着です。神様に非常にお願いし祈るということも結構なのですが、そこに難しい点があるのです。というのは、あまりに「助けたい」「助かりたい」というその執着が邪魔することになるのです。だからお願いしお祈りするのはよいですが、ある程度までであっさりとしておくのです。「どうしても助かりたい、助かりたい」という強い執着は取るのです。むしろそういう時には「命のないものなら早く霊界にやらしていただきたい、助かるものなら助けていただきたい」とあっさりするのです。そういう時にあっさりするということは非常に難しいですが、その執着の心が非常に邪魔するのです。そういう時に助けるのは正守護神で、正守護神が神様に力をいただいて助けるのですが、正守護神の霊が働くのです。そういう時に側の者があんまり強い執着ですと、正守護神が働く場合に邪魔になるのです。そこで逆効果になるわけです。その点をよく知らなければいけません。』

「井関勇吉（五十九歳）。昭和十五年夏ごろ、たいへんに疲労を覚え、医診の結果糖尿病とのことで、毎日インシュリン、ブドウ糖の注射をし、内服薬も用い、食事は糖分は控え目に、魚肉類を多く摂るようにしておりました。昭和十六年バセドー氏病を併発し、疲労感がいっそう加わり、十九年九月ごろ一時小康を得ましたが、月に面疔および鼻梁軟骨炎を併発し、約三カ月床につき、インシュリンの代用薬ミニグリン、インペリンなどの注射をうち、手術はいたしませんでしたが、鼻、眼の縁から排膿し、漸次快復に向かいました。二十三年秋ごろから眼が充血し、視力減退し、医診の結果、腎臓病併発のため眼底出血し、失明の直前で、同時に糖尿病も悪化し、放置すれば生命が危険とのことで入院し、毎食前にインシュリン、ビタミンＣ、ニッサリジンなど注射および服薬し、一週二回眼球の注射などを三カ月続けました。他に漢方薬、ニワトコ、木ササギ、トウモロコシなども一カ月ほど服薬いたしましたが、思わしくありませんでした。二十五年五月、本教の福音をうけたまわり、御浄霊をいただき、七月に退院し、一切の医薬を廃し、御浄霊におすがりするようになりましてより、身動きもできなかったお腹の膨れも、だんだんと引き、楽になり、ほとんど盲目に近かった視力もやや恢復し、少しずつ読み書きもできるまでになりましたので、二十五年秋から二十六年秋まで公務のために身心を使い、それまでいただいておりました会長先生および支部長先生の御浄霊も怠りがちとなり、またまた悪化し、御浄化が激しくなってまいりました。その間指導者の方々より、先生方の御浄霊はでき得る限り多くいただき、また御高恩にお報い奉るべく人々をお救いするようにとお話いただきながら、忙しさや我事に追われ、御報恩も意に任せず、御浄霊もたまにいただく程度にて、まことに申し訳なく心よりお詫び申し上げております。今日では頭から足の指先まで腫れ上がり、腹部は太鼓のようで、副睾丸は握り拳三つほどの大きさに腫れ、横臥することもできません。昨年末より咳をしきりにいたし、濃い痰が出るようになり、体を動かしますと咳が出て、腹部に力が入り、膨満と咳の圧迫のためにか、副睾丸が痛み、呼吸が困難になります。一月七日、代人にて御参拝させていただきましたが、代人出立の日御守護いただき下痢をいたし、同時に副睾丸はだんだん小さくなり、咳激しく、痰も多量に出させていただき、だいぶ楽にさせていただきました。なお、下痢は未だ激しく続いておりますが、三日前より異常な眠気を催しております。現在もっとも苦しいのは、腹部膨満のため胸部圧迫され、胸元が息苦しい状態でございます。尿量は非常に少なくなっております。御浄霊は一日四、五回いただいております。なお、今回も代人にて御参拝させていただいております。光明如来様、御屏風観音様は御奉斎させていただき、ひたすらおすがりさせていただいておりますが、御浄霊の急所御教示のほどお願い申し上げます。」 『これは、急所は――命を救われたことを忘れたことが急所です。大体この人は命がなかったんです。これは非常な薬毒ですよ。医学の犠牲者ですね。気の毒なものですね。そうして、せっかく務めができるまでに治ったら、すぐに神様のために働かなければならない。命は神様にいただいたんですからね。だから、私有物じゃない。助かってからの命は神有物なんです。ところが自分勝手にしたから御守護が離れたんです。だから、こういうことになるのはあたりまえです。だから、そこを自覚しなければならない。神様からいただくということは、神様の御用をしろと言っていただくんですから、そういうのは神様以外のことはできないんです。こういうのはたくさんあるんです。ところが、それを私有物にして、せっかくいただいた命を勝手に使って――いったん神様からいただいた命を、会社かなにかに使っては、人が助かりません。そうでなく――神様は、命をやるから御神業に使えと言ってくださったんです。それを忘れた。この点は指導者も責任があります。それは言ったでしょう。しかし、言い方が足りなかった。断乎として言えば――他のことをしては命はない。神様以外のことはいけないと、断乎として言うんです。それで言うことを聞かなければ、突っ離す。だから、浄霊も良いですが、腹の中から――間違っていた。今度治ったら人助けをさせていただく。だから、もう一ぺん、命をいただきたいとお願いするんですね。それで、神様が聞き届けられたら、助かりますが、神様がもう駄目だ――なかなか神様は、そういうところは厳しいですからね。もう駄目だ。お前は霊界に行って働けと言われたら、もうしかたがないですがね。』 ２ 無い命を頂いた方に対する御導きについて 〔 御講話（S28年5月15日） 『御教え集』22号、昭和28(1953)年6月15日発行〕 『本当は再浄化というものは起るべきものではありません。しかし起るべきものではないと言っても、ある程度はやむを得ないが、再浄化で命がなくなるということはありません。再浄化のあるのは、ほとんど結核ですが、医者から見放されてぜんぜん死ぬに決まったような者が助けられるとしたら、その命の恩はたいへんなものですから、いかなるものを犠牲にしても、命の代わりとして感謝しなければなりません。感謝するということは奉仕しなければならないのです。それをボヤボヤしているから、神様は横を向かれるのはあたりまえです。だから再浄化が起るということは、再浄化が起るようにしているのです。それで今の人はやっぱり医学迷信のために、お医者でなおったのは非常にありがたがるのです。ところが信仰でなおったのは有難味が少ないのです。というのは、信仰でなおるべきものではないと思っているから、「なおったのは時節が来たのではないか」あるいは「今までたくさんのんだ薬が効いてきたのではないか」というような解釈をする人があるのです。ところがお医者の方でなおったのはじき忘れるが、神様の方は、そういう理屈に合わないことは絶対に許されないのです。しかし、今までは和光同塵で、少しは許されてきたのですが、これからは絶対にお許しにならないのです。大本教のお筆先に「神厳しくなると人民穏かになるぞよ」というのがありますが、うまく言ってあります。それについてはっきり書きました。』 ３ 命を救われた人の生命は神有物なる事 〔 御講話（S28年5月26日） 『御教え集』22号、昭和28(1953)年6月15日発行〕 （御論文「 信仰の合理性と再浄化 」）【栄光 二一〇号】 『命にかかわらない病気ならそうでもないが、命にかかわるような病気がなおれば、命をいただいたのですから、なおってよいあんばいだと金儲けだとか相変わらずなことをしていると、せっかくくださった命を自分のことに利用してしまうことになるので、つまりいつも言うとおり、自分の命だと私有財産みたいに思ってしまうので、そこにたいへんなくい違いがあるのです。以前に、鉱山をやっている人で、そうとうに年をとった人ですが、心臓病で命のないところを助かったのです。それで自分は一生懸命に神様のために働くと口では言っているが、いつの間にか山に行って、しばらく見えないからどうしたかと思っていると、その人はそうとうの資本家で経営者であるから鉱山に行っていたが、具合が悪くなってあわてて帰ってきて、治療をしてもらうと良くなって、今度はよいだろうと思うと、また行ってしまうのです。そういうことがたびたびあったので、とうとう私は「あの人は駄目だから方っておけ」と言っておきましたが、それからしばらくして死んでしまいました。この人などはあんまり命を粗末にするのでもったいないくらいなものです。こういう人はめったにありませんが、これに似たようなことはよく聞きます。お蔭話などにもよく出てきますが、難病がなおって、そうして神様はたいしたものだと言いながら、この次再浄化で悪くなると医者に行くのです。そうしてさんざんやってもらって、今度は前よりも悪くなって、やっぱりこれは神様にすがろうと来る、それで今度なおると、そこで初めて分かるのです。実に世話がかかるのですが、よくそういう人があります。だからそういった大きなお蔭をいただいて命を助かった人は、これから大いに注意してやるのです。そうすれば再浄化はよほど少なくなります。そこで万一再浄化が起った場合には、なぜ起ったかという意味を、今のようなわけだということを話してやるとよいです。大体どんな病気でも、なおればそれよりか重い病気が起るわけはありません。第二の起り方ですから、軽くすむわけです。ところが再浄化の方がかえって重い場合が多いのです。ということは人間の方が間違っているからです。』 〔 御講話（S28年5月17日） 『御教え集』22号、昭和28(1953)年6月15日発行〕 （御論文「 信仰の合理性と再浄化 」）【栄光 二一〇号】 『ですから再浄化もあるにはありますが、最初の病気よりも軽くすむわけなのです。一番最初、浄霊を受ける時が一番重くて、それがいったんなおるということは、それだけ一番大きな峠を越えたわけです。もしその次に再浄化が起るとすると、最初よりいくぶんか軽くなるのがあたりまえです。ところが軽くならないというところに、人間の間違いがあるわけです。』 ４ 御恩報謝の不足が再浄化の根本原因 〔 信仰の合理性と再浄化 『栄光』210号、昭和28(1953)年5月27日発行〕 『これによっても分るごとく、死を覚悟し絶望的となった重病患者が全治したとしたら、何を措（お）いても力の限り、神様に御恩報じをするのが当然であり、これが合理であるにかかわらず、忘れるとしたら御蔭の取りっ放しであり、恩知らずもはなはだしいのである。この理を一層分り易くいってみると、例えば生命の価値を十とすれば、十の感謝ならプラスマイナスであるが、十以上であればその余分だけはプラスになり、神様はその何倍にも当る御恵みを下さるものである。それと反対に感謝が五とすれば、差引五だけマイナスとなるから神様への借金となる。そこで一日も早く御返しすればいいが、それを怠（おこた）るとすると利息が嵩（かさ）んで借金は増えてゆく。この点現界と少しも変りはないので、これも相応の理である。そこで借金が溜ってある程度を越えると、神権裁判所から督促（とくそく）や差押えが来る。これが再浄化であるから、それに気が付き心からお詫びをすると共に、元利合計御払いすれば助かるのは当然である。』 13 信徒の死について 一、神の律法と人間の死について １ 律法と死 〔 苦集滅道道法礼節 『栄光』102号、昭和26(1951)年5月2日発行〕 『法とは人間が作った法律のみではなく、神の律法もあってこれは目には見えないが、絶対犯す事が出来ない、人間諸々（もろもろ）の災は、ことごとく神の律法を犯すための刑罰である事を知らねばならない、実はこの刑罰こそ人間の法律よりも恐ろしいと共に、絶対免れる事は出来ないのである。もちろん、死刑もあるのであって、それが災害による死、病死等すべて神律を犯したための刑罰死である。』 ２ 死に対する原則的な考え方 〔 御講話（S28年11月17日） 『御教え集』28号、昭和28(1953)年12月15日発行〕 『それから神様は、人間というものは働かせるようにできているのですから、本当に神様の御意志通りの働きができれば、その人は神様の方では重要な人ですから、なるべく病気で苦しまないように、長生きをするように、いつまでも働けるようにと、神様の方でやるのです。ところがあんがい早く死んでしまったりするのは、神様の方に対して、世の中のために間違ったことをしたり、間違った考えを持っているからして、どうしても神様の方では、その人を間引かなければならないのです。そういうことは一点の狂いもなくやられているのですが、ただ人間がそれを看破することができないだけのことです。』 二、 死の原因を分類する １ 心からすがらぬ場合 〔 妙智之光（地上天国３号） 、昭和24(1949)年4月20日発行〕 『浄霊によっても死ぬのは多くの場合心から神にすがらぬからで、その人の信仰のどこかに不純な点があることが多い。いっさいを擲（なげう）って神にすがる人は不治とみらるる病もたいていは助かるものである。信仰の浅い人は危機の場合迷いが生じやすいのでそのとたんに神の救いの網が切れるのである。』 ２ 〔 御光話（S24年5月特輯号） 『御光話録』8号、昭和24(1949)年5月30日発行〕 ――私宅では去年と今年と二回子供が生まれましたが、二回とも生後すぐ死亡いたしました（いずれも三日目）。これはなにか因縁がありましょうか。 『ありますね。こういう死に方をするべきはずのものではないですからね。』 ① 怨 霊 『こんなのは霊が障ってるわけですね。つまり怨みの霊ですね。』 ② 親の罪の為 『そういうことと、もう一つは主人公が罪を犯しているかですね。これは『信仰雑話』の中に「夫婦の道」って書きましたね、ああいうことか、』 ③ 子の授れない因縁のある場合 『あるいはなにか子供を授れない因縁にあるかですね。』 ３ 親の罪（人工流産） 〔 御講話（S28年5月26日） 『御教え集』22号、昭和28(1953)年6月15日発行〕 （御論文「 信仰の合理性に就いて 」）【栄光 二一三号】 『個人的間違いは秘しておくと書いてありますが、これがまたたいへんなことなのです。二番目の子供を産んで、七カ月くらいたった時にまた妊娠したのですが、そのくらいで妊娠すると前の子供が育たないということを人から聞いて、それを信じて堕胎したのです。今は妊娠中絶という体裁のよい言葉がついてますが、実は堕胎をしたのです。ですから母親に言ったのです。堕胎というのは殺人だ。わが子を殺すという子殺しの罪になるから、それも子供の病気に関係しているのだと言ってやりました。今朝か昨夜聞いたところによると、肺炎の子供は死んだそうです。ですからそれも大いに原因しているわけです。というのは、神様の方では、せっかく与えた子供を殺すということは、それではお前には子はいらないのだろうから、そういうのに与えた子供は、やはり召し上げるという理屈になるわけです。理屈に合わないことをすれば理屈に合わない結果になってしまいます。少なくとも信仰にはいっていながら堕胎などをするということは、とんでもない罪を犯したのです。それも、あとのやり方が理屈にあっていて、そうして非常に悔悟して、自分はとんでもない間違ったことをしたと言ってお詫びをすれば、あるいは助かったかもしれないが、そういうことも支部長はあんまり言わなかったらしいので、私がそう言ったらびっくりしてました。そうすると支部長のやり方がもっとも間違っていたのです。それでも支部長がそれに気がついて、心からお詫びをして、父親か母親に子供の浄霊をさせるというようにすると、助からないことはなかったが、神様は厳しいのです。しかし理屈に合えば、神様は愛ですが、理屈に合わなければ神様はどうしようもないのです。神様は御利益をいくらでも与えたいのです。ところが資格がないのです。』 ４ 一家の贖罪の為霊界の御用の方が大きい場合 〔 御垂示（S29年3月1日） 『御垂示録』29号、昭和29(1954)年3月15日発行〕 『祖霊が、祖先以来の罪が非常に多いために誰かを犠牲にしなければならない。それともう一つは、祖霊の罪の種類によって、現界で働くよりか霊界で働いたほうが罪が早く消える場合もあるのです。ですから、犠牲にする場合と、霊界で働かせる場合と、そのためにそこの子孫の、大勢いる中で、誰かを代表者にして、祖先の罪を早く消す場合は、むしろ祖霊が神様にお願いして、早く罪をとっていただきたいという場合には犠牲にしたほうがよいことになるのです。だからそこのところはいろいろあるのです。けれども、要するに、信仰に入ってから犠牲になるのは非常によい理由があるのです。昨夜読んだお蔭話の中にも、ちょうどそういうのがありました。子供だか何かが亡くなって、母親が非常に嘆いて、いくらか神様を怨むような気持ちがあったのです。その内に祖先の霊か何かが憑って来て、それはこういう理由だということをすっかり話したのです。それで初めて「たいへんよいことだった、ありがたい」ということが分かって、非常に感謝しているというようなことが書いてありました。だから非常に複雑な意味と、いろいろなことがありますから、簡単には言えないです。それから、信仰に入ってからは、どんなことがあっても、それは良くならんがための一つの形をとるのだから、喜んでよいわけです。それは時日がたつと必ず分かります。』 ５ 亡くなった方が当人も家族も幸福な場合 〔 御光話（S24年5月特輯号） 『御光話録』8号、昭和24(1949)年5月30日発行〕 『また、こういうことも考えに入れておいていいですね。なんでもかんでも子供があれば仕合せになるとは限らないですからね。かえって子供の不幸になることもあります。例えば、片輪の子だとか、大きくなって放蕩して家の財産を潰すとかね。だから、子供ってのはちゃんと育って親の仕合せを助けるのでなければ本当の子宝とは言えませんね。勿論そんな不仕合せは子供が親の罪を浄化するわけですからね。信仰に入ってたくさんの人を助ければ、その徳によって罪も減り怨みも減りますからね。立派な子供ができますよ。信仰に入ってからの子供って立派ですね。しかし、あんまり薬を服んだ人の子供は毒が多いですがね。』 〔 御垂示（S27年10月1日） 『御垂示録』14号、昭和27(1952)年10月15日発行〕 『しかし、こういうことを知っておかなければならない。仮にそれがどうしても治らないというと、そこの家の人が、親なら親が信仰によって非常に徳を積むと死んでしまうのです。 それは、生きているということが苦痛だから、生まれ変らしていただくということです。ですからお蔭をいただくと死にます。これはたいへんなお蔭です。そうすると本人も普通の人間に生まれ変って、一家も苦痛から解放されるから幸福になるわけです。ですからそういうお蔭をいただくと死ぬことになる。その点は神様は気が利いてます。そうかと言って、殺人罪になりますから殺すわけにはいきません。しかし生きていると親だって一生困りますが、霊界に行けば一番良いです。』 〔 御垂示（S29年3月1日） 『御垂示録』29号、昭和29(1954)年3月15日発行〕 『それからまたこういうことがあります。どうして助からない子供は、一生を不幸に終わり、子供が生きていると親も不幸だ、という場合には、神様は早く死なせます。そうすると親は悩みがとれるから非常に楽になります。それはたいへんな御神徳になるのです。この子供は治るかさもなければ命がなくなるか、どっちかにしてもらわなければ、親がたまらないわけです。そういう場合に、医者が手術したり、いろんなことをしたために、どうしても助からないと、決まった子供は、早く霊界にやって下さるのです。そうすると、親が、決まりがつきますから――そういう御神徳もあります。ですから、治るか駄目か、どっちかという片づき方が早くなるわけです。』 三、参 考 １ 善人が助からず悪人が助かる場合のあるのは 〔 妙智之光（地上天国３号） 、昭和24(1949)年4月20日発行〕 「浄霊によって善人と思われる人が助からぬ場合があるのにまったく悪人としか思えない人で助かる場合がありますのはいかなる理由でしょうか。」 『一般に人間の眼からみて善人悪人を決めるが大いなる間違いである。これは神様からみると往々異う場合がある。 「信仰雑話」にあるごとくすべて小乗と大乗とあってこれによって見方が違う。人を観る場合大乗的にみなくてはいけない。善人と言っても本当の善人は極めて少ないので、ふつう善人というのはたいてい意気地なしで、概して働きのある人は多く悪人に見えるものである。神様の御眼からみれば善人といっても役に立たぬ人間はこの世の穀つぶしで一種の悪人である。大善をする場合は必ず小悪を伴うもので、これはしかたがないのである。その際小悪のみをみると悪人としか出見えない。また悪人からみれば善人は悪人である。 要するに簡単に善悪を決めることはできない。善悪はまた時代によっても違う。忠君愛国思想も民主主義の現在では悪になる。要するに全人類平等に幸福にすることでなくて〔は〕本当の善ではない。』 ２ 一家の贖罪の為の死の一例 〔 御垂示（S26年11月8日） 『御垂示録』4号、昭和26(1951)年12月10日発行〕 「西平クニ（五月入信）入信動機は、主人の歯痛が良くなり、御屏風観音様をお祀りされました。九月十日の夕方、橋の上でトラックに跳ね飛ばされて即死しました。夫婦共入信しており、一家に反対者もおりません。一家の大きな贖罪だと、割り切っており、信仰は熱心でございます」 『おかしいな。よほど事情があるんですね。普通じゃないですね。そういうのは、こういう意味ですね。そこの一家に非常に罪があるんです。その場合に、その罪をなくしなければ、一家が本当に幸せにならない。そういう場合に。誰かを犠牲にしなければならない。子供はないんですか。』 「五、六人おります。みんな頭が良く、長男は青年団長をしております」 『おっ母さんはいくつです。』 「四十七歳でございます」 『そこで、誰かを犠牲にしなければ罪が消えないために、奥さんが選ばれたのです。そういうことはめったにないが、たまにはないことはない。そこで、かえって主人公が熱心になる。と言うのは、そういう意味です。たまにはそういうことはしかたがないですね。なにしろ霊界がだんだん、最後に近づいてくるんで、祖霊なんかもあせって、早く罪を取る手段をやるわけです。』 ３ 御浄霊頂いていた方が死亡した場合一時発展の妨げになりますが 〔 御光話（S24年 2月18日） 『御光話録』4号、昭和24(1949)年＊月＊日発行〕 ――御浄霊していて死亡した場合、一時発展の妨げになりますが、これはいかがいたすべきでしょうか。 『これはうっちゃらかしておけばいいんです。死んだ霊が霊界で働いてくれますから。自分が死んだため迷惑をかけたのを取り戻そうとして大いに働いてくれますからね。』 ４ 教師の人の亡くなるのは 〔 御垂示（ S27年2月**日) 『御垂示録』7号、昭和27(1952)年3月10日発行〕 「教師の人で亡くなるのは、主としてどういう理由でございましょうか」 『いろいろありますがね。一番の原因は、本当に解らないため――信仰がね。要するに、神様のお邪魔をするんですね。しかし、お邪魔をしようと思ってしているんじゃない。自分は良いと思っていることが、自分の智慧証覚が解らないためにお邪魔になっている。それで死ぬ場合もあるしね。しかし、そういうのは、死んでも霊界に行って――間違ったことは審（さば）かれるが――やっぱり神様のために働く、霊界で大いに信者を作ってます。だから、簡単にどうこうということは言えない。』

――― 関 連 出 版 物 ――― メシヤ教批判 『メシヤ教批判』昭和26(1951)年9月25日発行、日本宗教新聞社刊 世に憎まれたメシヤ教 岩崎 栄 メシヤ教――旧、観音教――通称、お光り様。教祖岡田茂吉。当年六十八歳。 これこそは終戦後、わが国での、憎まれものの最たるものであったろう。 「怪しからン」というのである。 「インチキ極まる」と罵るのだ。 「やッつけろ！ 叩き潰さにャいかン」と叫ぶのだ。 戦後、わずか数年の間に、片手を振りながら、巨万の富を掻き集めたというのだ。手を振ッて儲ける商買は、株屋もそうだが、これには損、得、――表、裏というものがある。メシヤ教のは掻き集める一方で、決してロスというものが無いのだから、言語同断だという。 片手を振る――これを（御浄霊する）と称し、まことに非科学約な実にコドモだましに類する、たわいもない迷信を流布し、もって、無智無学な衆愚の懐中を絞りあげているというのである。 ぜんたい、どの程度の絞りあげかといえば、「まず、うちわに見て、全国に三十万の信徒ありと仮定し、一カ月、一人平均十円を絞り上げると見て、月額三百万円。その他に何や彼やで、年につもれは、すくなくとも五六千方円という巨額だ」 「何か、お守りみたいなものがあるそうじゃないか、光という字一字書いた」 「それだよ、インチキからくりの根元が。その紙片一枚を千円とか二千円とかで買わなきゃ、信者ということにならンのだ。仮りに千円としても、三十万人だと三億だ」 「あゝ三億！ 凄いね」 「だから征伐しなきゃいけないンだ」 「しかし待てよ、三億は大金だが、だから征伐しなくてはいけないという公式は成り立たないぞ。いくら大金にしてもさ、信者が得心ずくで納めるものならそれでいいじャないか」 「なにをバカな！ 無智にして憐れむべき信者たちは、皆、騙れて持ち込むンだ」 「例のあの手さ、またもあの手で騙されたってね」 「冗談じゃない」 「冗談じゃないよ、まったく。御浄霊と称し手を振って万病を、たちどころに癒し、農作物を増収させ、医薬も、肥料も全然不要だッていうンだ。まるで、文化の反逆なンだ。愚昧と安逸と迷信とへの煽動によっての金儲けなンだ。闇成金の大魔王だ。冗談どころの騒ぎじゃない。すべからく、速かに、文化国家の面目として撲滅せざるべからすだよ」 「へえ！ 大変な野郎なンだね」 「そうだよ。単純な（お有難屋）とか、誇大妾想狂じゃないンだ。おそるべき智能犯なンだ。同じイカサマ宗教にしても君、踊る宗教なンてのは、たあいがなくて、無邪気で、むしろ可愛いがね、お光り氏と来たら、こいつはキミ、計画的宗教企業なンだからね、下町の古道具屋か何か、小商人の伜で、彼自身、若いころには小間物屋をしてたというンだもの。小間物店といえばキミ、ヘドのことだ。そンなところから神さまが産れるものか。バカバカしい」 「だけど、それァキミ、馬小舎の中から、父無し児のキリストが産れたッてためしもあるし、日蓮は漁師の母アが、網納屋で産ンだッていうぜ」 「だけどキミ、キリストや日蓮はだ、すくなくとも、お守り札を売って金儲けしたり、巨万の富を積んで脱税したりはしなかったよ」 以上のような会話は、ここ数年来――今日もなお、サロンで、酒場で、事務室で、乗り物の中で、到るところで、いわゆるインテリ階級といわれる人たちの話題として、頻りにやり取りされている。まッたく、轟々たる世論の目標となっているのだ。 メシヤ教は、その教是として、無医薬治病と無肥料栽培を力説するのだが、これに対する科学者、医薬業者、肥料製産者、及び一般知識階層の非難と反感と憎悪とは、まことに暴風の如くに、強大熾烈を極めている。 検察当局、これがついに、メシヤ教の動静、在り方について、疑惑の眼を光らせるようになった。 敗戦後の軍部は、某々右翼機関（たとえば児玉機関の如きもの）と共謀し、中国の儲備銀行に在った大金魂を、このメシヤ教に売りつけたという流説や、投書によって、検事警察は俄に緊張して来たが、更にメシヤ教はダイヤモンドその他の貴金属、物統令違反の物資を隠匿山積しているということ、それから、邪教に付きもののいかがわしい風紀問題。そうした風説によって一層の刺戟を受けた。 そこへ持って来て、メシヤ教の何千万円の所得税怠納という問題が突発した。 教団の財産であるところの莫大な土地、家屋、それから巨額の収入。そうしたものを宗教法人とせずして、教主岡田茂吉個人名義としていたために、同じく現代日本の知識階級であるところの税務吏が、合法的に課税し得る最大限度税率を、これに賦課して来たものであった。 「ざまア見ろ！ インチキ観音教」 世論は痛快がった。ことここに至れば、もはや、新聞、雑誌――所謂商業ジャアナリズムが黙っている筈はない。 東京の大新聞、Ａ、Ｂ、Ｄ等、等が前後して筆を動かしかけた。脱税問題その他を取りあげ、この教団の内部曝露、異常な膨張発展の裏面検討――そうした方向に筆誅の鉾先を揃えて行った。やがて綜合雑誌、大衆読物誌、婦人雑誌など、絶好の課題に、われのみおくれてなるものか、といった調子で乗り出した。 それらの記者のある者は、これを外面から攻撃した。風評、流説、中傷、讒誣、すべてを綜合し、それに、自分の先入感と、合理的想像を加味した攻勢記者だッた。 またある記者たちは、メシヤ教の幹部に会ったし、二、三の者は直接に、教組岡田氏にインタアビューした。 筆者もまた、サンデー毎日誌及び、毎日グラフ誌の依嘱をうけて熱海に出張した一人であった。 週刊朝日は、話豪徳川夢声君を差し向けたし、某誌からは女流作家吉屋信子女史が出馬した。 それらの中で、最も痛烈を極めたものは、某誌に寄せた大宅壮一君の筆致だったが、果然、インテリ階層の読者は手をたたいて快哉を絶叫した。 比較的同情と理解を持ったかに思える書き方をしたのは吉屋女史で、一番公平無私だったのは、週刊朝日の徳川夢声君であった。 私は徳川君ほどの君子ではないから、他の新聞記者諸氏と同じような、ジャーナリストの探検、征伐慾を、多分に、旺盛に燃やしながら出かけたものだった。それというのが、私という人間が、もと新聞記者だったからである。 熱海に在るインチキ邪宗門的いわゆる新興宗教。そこの教組と称する強かな怪物岡田茂吉、イデ正体見破りくれん、という――それほどでもないが、まずそういったような気構えでもって出征に及んだわけだった。 私は昔の新聞の社会部記者だったが、ありていにいえば、決して上等の記者でなかったことは事実である。まず中等以下だったろう。この中以下の社会部記者の心理というものは、この私の当時の心もちが、一ばん適切にこれを代表していると思う。 先ず、なンでもかでも、世に栄え、はびこり、景気よく旺ンなるもの、これ悉く、本能的に憎悪し、反感し、そうした角度から睨んでかからなくては、虫がおさまらない、といった、性癖の私だった。 どこか、異常な事件は無いものだろうかと、毎日、犬のようにそこいらを嗅ぎ廻っていた。犬、そうだ、同じ犬の事件でも、犬が人に吹みついたのでは面白くない。人が犬に咬みついたというのならは愉快だ。更に、総理大臣か陸軍大将かが、ワン！と吠えて犬に咬みつかないものかなァ！ と、ひそかに念願していた。 椿事、不祥事、喧嘩出入、天災地妖――なンでも騒動や不幸は、大きいほど嬉しく、従ってまた大きからんことを希い願っていた。 美談よりも醜聞を好んだし、他人のことは、生よりも死を珍重とした。 皇室に御慶事や何かがあっても、先ずそのことを利用して新聞が儲かり、読者数が拡張出来るようにと、ひたすらくふうを凝らした。まことにもって不忠無頼の痴れ者だったのだ。 問題を本筋に復えして――しかし、だから私は、熱海のメシヤ教に対しても、相手が極めて奇怪な存在たることを希望し、また予想もしたのであったが、ところが、こと、こころざしに反し、意外にもこれが平凡だったことに唖然とし、かつ失望した。あまりにも平々凡々過ぎるのであった。 なアンだ。これじャ、こっちの商買にならんではないかと思った。外面的に何らの構えがあるでなく、内部的にまた、なんの勿体ぶった設備もしてなく、シタタカな怪物という御当人の岡田教祖というのが、これがまた、つい、そこいらで、ざらに見かけるおタナの御隠居然たる人態なのだ。 この人と対談してみたが、別に何も、神懸ったことを言うでもなく、気取ッた態度を示すわけでもなかった。つまり、全然、舞台装置のない舞台で、全然芝居っ気のない言葉で、医薬療法の科学的に幼稚なことを語り、自然農法を説き、文化や、政治を論じ、小説や絵画や映画、演劇について、滔々と蘊蓄を傾けるだけなのだ。しかもこれが、下町調の江戸ッ児弁である。 だから、ありていに言えば、私は内心、これは記事にならないと、ガッカリしたわけである。でも、しかたがない、私は書いた。一問一答をそのままに書いた。眼に見た現実はそのままに描写した。同行の写真氏には、あるがままの現象を撮影して貰った。 そしてこれが毎日グラフとサンデー毎日とに発表されたのであった。ところが……… これを編集し発表した毎日グラフの責任者が、同じ社内の同僚から、とンでもない中傷非難の声を浴びせられたということを聞いて、私は、驚きはしなかったが、ああ、そういうことがあるのかなアと、淋しい気持にならされた。それは、その中傷非難というのは、当該編集責任者が、観音教から多額の金を貰って、同教の宣伝をしたといい出されたのだそうである。 私がかつて新聞記者であった時代にも、社内にそうしたことを頻りに流布して歩く小姑的人物が多くいたが、トンデモ・ハップン型のアプレ記者にも、やはりその亜流があとを絶たずにいるものと見える。 再び問題を本筋に戻すが、とかくメシヤ教は呪いの的である。憎まれ人気の覇者たるの観がある。まさに話題の王者といえよう。 ところで、こうした世論の、人気の動向に対して、最も敏感なものが、ユスリ屋と、それから検察当局との二者である。暴力と権力。不法を行うものと、正法を行使するものと、両極瑞が前後して動きだした。 無法者では、ジャーナリスト、ゴロツキ。政治ゴロツキ。宗教ゴロツキ、カストリゴロツキなどが、あの手、この手と押しかけたらしいが、手ごわくか、あるいは手柔らかくか、とにかく刎ねつけられて、トンと物にはならなかったらしい。 しかし、国家の法律を持って臨む警察力というものは、しかし、アッサリとは退却しない。 「なんとかして、岡田というやっを引ッ括ってやろう。どうにかして、メシヤ教を叩き潰してやらなきゃ……」 この一念が凝って、疾風迅雷の動きを見せたのが、昨年の六月である。 静岡の検察庁が奮起したのである。教組岡田茂吉氏は拘引され、監禁された。 熱海と、箱根の同教本部は一せいに手入れをうけ、厳重な家宅捜索をうけた。 「やったっ！ ついにやっつけた」 「天網恢恢粗にして洩らさすだ」 「どうか中途年端な処分でなく、徹底的に潰滅させて貰いたい」 司法官憲のこの壮挙は、世間の期待にピタリと嵌ったのである。 教主岡田茂吉の人間研究 一 何の飾りっ気もない、ただ簡素で、明るくて清潔な講堂で、メシヤ教の岡田教主は、毎日何百人かの善男善女を集め、まるで町内会のような形式で、談笑のうちに彼一流のお説教をくり展げている。 ――本教を平易な言葉で表わそうと思ったら、デパート教、これでもいいです。私が常に言っていることだが、本教には、基督教、神道、仏教、儒教、それから哲学、科学、文学芸術、なんでもが包含されています。それらの中で特に努力しているものに、科学の面では、病気と健康の問題、それから農耕の問題があり、他の面では芸術があります。 もちろん、本教はその名の示す如く、救世の大業を遂行するのが目的である以上、一切万有を救わなくてはなりよせん。故に、人事百般、いかなることにも、その誤りを指摘して、これに最高至上の指針を与えなけれはならないのは当然です。 いかにも現代文化の進歩は素晴らしいには相違ないが、同時に、欠点も素晴らしい。ところが、表面に現われている側は人の眼に見えるからいいとしても、内側、内面的欠陥は眼に見えにくい。そこでこれは、神の光明叡智に照らし出して是正するよりほかにしかたはないのです。 この意味から本教は、あらゆる既存文化の面にメスを入れて解剖し、その実態を明かにし、より良き世界の実現をと企図するものでありまして、かくいたしてこそ「天国的文化時代」の到来を期待し得るのであります―― そういうことを説いているかと思うと、 ――降参日本が、やっと講和日本になろうとしているが、コーサン・ニッポン、コーワ・ニッホン、やがてまた昔のコーワイニポンにならなきャいいがね―― あるいはまた ――赤痢は昨年の三倍といい、結核はますます増える一方でどうにもテが無いと悲鳴をあげている。そうですかねえ、なるほど医学はたいしたもンだねえ、イヤサ進歩したもンでござンすねえだ。このぶんで行きャ、いまに八千万の大半が病人。そこで大病院や大製薬工場の濫立――政府も医者も、面見合せて青イキ吐イキ。そのとき、メシヤ教という迷信邪教の信者だけがピンピンしているとしたら、そのときこそは、政府も医者も、こちらに手を合わせ、オタ、オタ、オタスケ……泣いてくるンだ。愉快だね―― また、 ――世界も、国家も、個人も、あらゆる問題を解決する鍵は「誠」である。政治の貧困は誠の貧困に他ならず。物資の不足も「誠」の不足。道義の頻廃も「誠」の欠如。秩序の紊乱もまた、「誠」の無いところに生じる。あらゆる忌わしき問題は、みなすべて「誠」の不足に起因する。 宗教も芸術も学問も、芯に「誠」がなかッたら、それは形骸に過ぎないのだ。 ああ！誠なるかな、誠なるかな！人類よ、問題解決の鍵はただ「誠」あるのみ―― また、 ――真の信仰は、言語行動が常識にはずれないこと。世間よくある神憑り的な態度、奇怪な言説、奇矯な行動、そうしたことを標榜する信仰は、まず警戒を要する。 また、自己の属する集団以外とは親しめない、といったような独善的信仰もいけない。 世界全人類を救うのが、宗教の使命なりと信じ、自己にのみこだわらす、排他的とならないようにするのが、真の信仰というものである。あたかも、自己一国の利益のみに捉われ、他国民の利害を無視した結果、あの惨澹たる敗戦の苦盃をなめることとなった日本のありさまを思って見ることだ。 信仰究極の目的は、完全な人間を作り上げることだと、私は信じている。完全なる完全は望み得べくもなかろうが、よくなくとも、完全に近づこうとする努力、修養――これが正しい信仰の在り方だと思う。 故に、信仰に徹すれは徹するに従って、ますます平凡普通の人間に見えてこなくてはならない。そうなるためには、信仰を咀嚼し、消化することだ。言動はいかにも常識的で、万人に好感を与え、この人は何を信仰しているのかわからない、というくらいにならなくてはウソだ。人に接するや春風の如く軟く、しかも謙譲で、親切で、他人の幸福と社会福祉を冀うてやまぬような人間でありたい。 まず自己の幸福を欲するならば、他人を幸福にすること、他人を幸福にすることによって自己に与えられる神の恩賜こそが真の幸福である―― また、 ――宗教と芸術の関係、因縁。人間の情操を高め、生活を豊かに、人生を楽しく意義あらしむるもの、それは実に芸術の使命である。 われらが理想とする地上天国は「芸術の世界」と言っても言い過ぎではない。それは「真、善、美」の世界であるが、芸術はその中の「美」の分野であろう。昔の高僧は、絵を描き、彫刻を得意とし、堂宇までを設計するが如き、驚くべき美の天才を発揮している。そうした人々の中でも、最も傑出した宗教芸術家として、聖徳太子を挙げることが出来よう。大和法隆寺のあの建築そこに内蔵する絵画、彫刻などの美術を見るとき、今を去る千二百年もの昔に、これだけの傑作を産み出したという素晴らしさに同感しない人はあるまい。私は、だから大いに芸術を鼓吹しようと考えているのだ―― も一つ、 ――いまの日本に不足しているもの、 米でなし、鉄でなく、石油でなし、金でない、電力でも、警察予備隊でも、結核患者のベッドでもない。一たい何だと訊くか。 なんでもありやァしないよ。ただ神に合掌する人間が不足なだけなんだよ。 どうしたい？ 眼を白黒させてやがらァ―― 更にこれは、徳川夢声君と岡田氏との対談だが、しかしあの週刊朝日に載ったあれとは別なもので、去る三月二十一日、夢声君の、講談というか何というか、例の吉川英治原作宮本武蔵、宝蔵院道場の一席を、岡田氏が聴いたそのあとでの両人の座談である。 岡田「よかったですね、あなたの武蔵、講談などと異った味だ」 夢声「原作者吉川さんと私との、試合のようなものでしてね」 岡田「非常に巧い。結極、魂の問題です」 夢声「私は週刊朝日で対談をやっていますが、どうです、私と一度おやりになりませんか。絶対相手を傷つけるようなことはしないつもりです」 岡田「ええやりましょう……あなたはクセ者型ですよ」 夢声「クセ者型はおそれ入ります。それはそちらさんも……でしょう」 岡田「わたしャ、そういう人が好きですね。何か一くせある人は面白い。つまりバランスのとれた人物という意味でね」 夢声「そのバランスを説教するんですか」 岡田「それを説くのはむつかしいですね」 夢声「ときに、霊というものはですな、私は、科学がもすこし進歩したら、これを測定出来るのではないかと思いますが……」 岡田「それは出来ます」 夢声「何か、ガイカース氏の、あの放射能測定みたいに」 岡田「つまり、機械で測定出来るようになりますよ。舌はそうした論文を、いま執筆中ですがね、現在の原子科学は中間子理論で行詰っているんだそうです。中間子も湯川さんが、偶然宇宙線の写真の中に発見されて確証されたんですが、これをもっと突き進めると、機城では測定出来ません。ズーッと先きへ行けば神に到達します。やがては科学の進歩によって実証されるでしょうが、現在ではこの中間子の極点と、神との間が空白になっている。そこまでは科学者の頭が行っていないのです。わたしはこれを科学的に説明して、理論神霊学と名付けています。これを読めばわからない筈はない。この手を、こう翳すと、すぐ病気がなおる。盲腸炎など実によく治る。これが即ち、実験神霊学なのですよ」 夢声「わたしは腹痛の場合、手をそこにあてて暫くそうしていると治ることがよくあるんですが、確に手から大変ないいものが出ています。霊気といいますかね」 岡田「それを説くのは、なかなかむつかしいことです」 夢声「いや、どうも有難うごぎいよした」 二 岡田茂吉という人の来歴、その生いたちというものは、まるで大衆小説のお涙頂戴物そっくりである。 この人は明治十五年に、東京浅草の橋場に生れたというが、橋場といえば当時は貧民街に近いような地域だった。そして明治の十五年ごろという年代は、文化の黎明に、弱少国日本が、ヒョロリ、クラリと歩き出したばかりで、非常に足もとの暗い、こんとんとした時代であったし、また、明治十年、あの西郷隆盛の西南の役があわった直後で、民のカマドに炊煙が絶えたといってもいいような不景気のドン底時代でもあった。徳川の永い間の封建制がたおれたけれど、それに代って更に、薩、長の藩閥封建が民衆の頭上を凍雲のように覆い固め、自由の太陽を冷たく遮断している。 「われらの自由を取り戻せよ！われらに民権を返せ！」 板垣退助や、いまのワンマン総理の父親竹内綱なぞが、百姓と町人を指導し、大いに自由民権のノロシをあげようとしたが、その板垣を、岐阜の演説会場に刺したものがあった。血にまみれて打ちたおれながら、「板垣死すとも自由は死せす」と絶叫して満天下の民衆を号泣させたのも、ちょうど明治十五年であった。 国も民も、そうした無明の嵐に吹き晒されているさなかに、怪物か聖者かと問題にされる後年の岡田茂吉は、まだ江戸のゴミがそのままにカビくさく匂っている細民窟で、古道具屋の伜と生れたのであった。 古道具屋といってもピンからキリまであるが、彼の父親は非常に貧乏していたから、これはピンでなく、キリの方に近いガラクタ屋に過ぎなかったらしい。もっとも彼の家系は、ゴンゲンさまこのかた、七、八代連綿たる江戸ッ児で、祖父の代までは有福な町人だったというが、ともかく彼は赤貧洗うが如き、店の間三畳、居間四畳、たったそれだけの家庭で、日陰の苔のように生い育ったのである。 店といっても、橋場の貧乏長屋へ、金の茶釜など掘り出しにくる客のあろう筈はない。日暮れを待って、そこから十町ばかりの、浅草の露店を出しに行く渡世なのだ。それも雨が降ればアブレてしまう。どうにか落ちていないかぎり、父親は小さな荷車に、僅少なガラクタを載せ、栄養失調の母親が、同じく栄養不足で枯木のように見える乳呑児をサルぐくりに、そのあとを押して出かける。ありがたや、観音さまの慈悲の袖。いくらかの鳥もくを握って、夜泣きゾバ一ぱいを、夫婦で半分わけの夜食に啜り、飢えた児にもその汁を吸わせて、夜更けの橋場に帰ってくる。その帰りみち、米屋を叩いて借りを払い、あすのお粥のシロに、一合か五勺を袋に入れて貰う。だから、雨が、ものの三日も降りつづくともうこの一家は釜のフタがあかない。父の顔は土のように蒼ざめ、母の乳房は梅干のように凋んでしまう。赤ン坊は消え入るように泣く。いくら泣いたって乳は一滴も出ない。やつれた母が、痩せた児を抱え、近所合壁に貰い乳をして歩く。 それでも赤ン坊は、どうにか生きて育った。育つには育ったが、こんな環境で完全な健康に育つ筈はない。少年茂吉は、かぼそい体躯に、あらゆる病弱の素を植えつけられながらどうにか、こうにか、小学校に通う年ごろとなった。 貧しくはあったがしかし、この古道具屋夫婦は、信仰に篤い性質のものだったようだ。産は破れても、心は破れない夫婦だったのだろう。乏しさの限りを、なおギリギリに切りつめても、子供の教育だけはおろそかにはしなかった。ところでこの、栄養不良の病弱児童だが、学校に上げてみると、バカに成績がいい。たいていは級の一番、一番に外れても、三番とさがることはなかった。まったく親子協力の、螢雪の苦を積んでいった。 燈下親しみ、また薬餌にも親しみ通した。眼病、頭痛、腹痛、下痢――年中カゼをひき、いつも咳をしていて、遊びともだちの健康さを羨望しつづけた。 明治二十八年、学業優良、体質劣弱の岡田茂吉少年は、首席で小学校を卒業した。明治二十八年といえば、日清戦争の終った年である。一将功成り万骨枯れ、二、三の豪商富み栄え、何千万の民、重税に痩せ細ったころである。 浅草貧民窟のガラクタ道具屋では、貧しい夫婦が夜毎重大会議を開いていた。可愛いムスコを上の学校に上げるかどうか、という懸案についてである。 ムスコは美術学校に入れてくれろ、将来世界第一の絵描きになるンだという。 五六十年も昔の、場末の露天商い渡世で、子供を高等小学校まで出すということは、今日の貧民階級が、大学を卒業させる以上に異常のフンパツだった。しかも、この露天商人のムスコは、まだその上の学校に行きたいと泣いてたのむのだった。 けっきょく、夫婦の寿命を削っても、この児には学問をさせるべきだという結論に到達した。食うや食わすでためた金が何十円かになっていた。当時の何十円、今日の何千円？一万近い金だったろう。 美術学校の予備校に入学させられた茂吉少年の歓喜は言語に絶するほどのものだったろう。青い鳥は目の前を飛んでいたろう。 だが彼は烈しい眼病にたおれてしまった。入学わずかに半歳、ついに中途退学せざるを得なかった。盲目になりかかったのだ。 ああ！ 神も仏もないものかと、親も子もともに動哭した。 眼病の上に、更に肋膜炎が襲いかかった。すでに眼病で二カ年の間、あらゆる眼科病院を巡礼し、すこしの効果も見えなかったが、十数年父母惨苦の貯蓄は、学費でなくて医薬のために費消しつくした。さてロクマク。もはや金がないからやむを得ず大学病院の施療患者となって入院し、胸に孔をあけて水をとり、半歳で退院したが、一年後に再発。 これが漸時悪化の病勢をとり、更に一年余り経ったこと、堂々たる肺結核に進んだ。父母はまた、治療費のため、食うや食わずの苦行をつづけた。入沢博士により、不治の宣告をうけた。しかし爾来数年、菜食一点張りの自己療養でどうにか健康をとり戻した。だが、この小康を取り戻すための犠牲となって、辛酸以外に何物にも恵まれなかった父の一生が亡びた。父。えらい父だった。彼二十五歳、母と二人、九尺間口の店を借りて小間物屋を営むだけの資金が、父の預金通帳に蓄わえられてあったのだ。 「スキ油一個、一銭、へいまい度ありがとうございます」――といった彼の人世首途。 不慣れな仕事に精根を涸らしているうち、半年ばかりで烈しい心身の衰弱に陥り、脳貧血となり、往来で、電車の轢る音に眩暈を起こして卒倒したり、十分間くらいも他人と話をしていると、口がきけなくなッてフラフラするような状態だった。 こうした病躯を、灸と散歩で癒し、商買の努力をつづけていると、しだいに店が発展し、ついに小売屋から却問屋となり、十年後には京橋で一流のノレンに数えられるほどに成功した。しかし病気の方も、いよいよますます盛んにして、毎年三度くらいは病気に罹る。その病気は、さすが小間物屋だけに、種々雑多な種類を経験する。まず歯痛。毎日四五本の歯が順々に痛む。その痛みたるや、彼を何度も自殺に馳りたてたほどの猛烈さだった。 それから重症チブス。このときはついに、遺言をして入院した。でも三カ月で治った。次が痔の出血、それで入院一カ月、次いで胃病。次がレオマチス、それから尿道炎――そしてこの間を、頻繁にして執拗な扁桃腺炎、神経衰弱、頭痛、腸カタルなどが、さながら伴奏の如くに点綴するのだった。 この病気に並行して、しかし商買は順調に発展し、父の残した三千五百円で始めた店が十年あまりで十五万円ばかりの資産を産んだ。大正八年ごろのことだから、その十五万円はたいしたもので、東京一流の大問屋として認められるようになった。ところで、茂吉さんは更にこれを百万円に太らせようと計画し、店を資本金二百万円の株式会社に変更し自分で社長となって健闘した。 百万円、それは今日の貨幣価値に換算すれは何億という巨額であろう。なんのためにかくも途方もない大プランをたてたかというに、それが実に、朝日、毎日に劣らぬほどの新聞社をつくろうという下心なのである。 そんな新聞をつくってどうするのかといえは、それによってあらゆる社会悪を打倒し、政治を改革し、一挙にしてこの地上に天国を出現させようとする、三十八歳の岡田青年の夢なのだ。 当時、日本は第一次欧洲大戦直後の黄金時代であった。カイザーのドイツは亡び、ツアーのロシアも亡び、英、米、仏その他目ぼしい欧洲の諸強国が戦傷のいたでに喘ぎつつあるとき、大いに火事場泥棒を稼いで肥った日本である。 不義の富貴、浮雲の栄華、王侯、貴族、富豪、政治家、官吏 町人、百姓、みな滔々として腐敗堕落の段階を転落していた。 そして天譴！ 大正十年春の第パニック。一朝にして肥大したこの国の経済は、一夜にして土崩瓦解し去った。残骸、死屍累々――その中に、ごたぶんに洩れず、二百万円の岡田株式金融の夢のカケラも踏み潰されてあったのだ。 しかし、馬車馬のような岡田茂吉は、そのガラガラから再び経ち上った。なにがどうあろうと、新聞を！という熱意に燃え立っているのだった。そして再び、百万円の夢が現実に近づくかに見えたとき、取引銀行が取付けにあい、支払停止――やがて破産。彼もまた破産。でも三度び立ち上った。そのとき、最愛の、苦楽をともにと誓い合って来た妻が、病気に罹り、間もなく妊娠五カ月の体で亡くなった。 まことに悲風、惨雨。荒涼たる彼の人生であった。打ちつすく不幸の連打に、彼は心のよりどころを神に求めて宗教巡礼者となッた。 しかし、百万円の夢は決して忘れない。四度び奮起し、ようやくにして岡田株式金融の整理と出発を見た。いざこれから、最後の運だめしというところで、またしてもガラガラッと例の大正十二年の大震災であった。 もはや致命的な痛打である。かくなる上は、すべてをすてて神。神を求めて、永遠の遍路にと出発するよりほかに、生きる力も、めどもありはしなかッた。 彼は大本教に入信した。大本教が、当時の宗教としては、最も新鮮に、清気ある宗教だったから、つまり、旧い死火山ばかりの宗教界で、ひとりこの宗門のみが生きていると見たからであるが、それにしても、徹底せるリアリストで、コチコチに頑固な無神論者だった彼が、ここに生命の泉を求めようとしたのはよくよくのことである。 生前の現実に破れたところの敗者が、宗教というオアシスに逃げ込むという、これは普通のことだが、この人の場合は単にそれだけの理由ではなかった。やはり新聞に代るものとしてここに走ったという意味もあるのだった。社会悪を滅ぼすための闘いに、新聞なぞは手ぬるし。どうしても、人間の魂を根底から揺り動かして目醒めさせる以外に、悪のない社会を出現せしめる道はない。その人間の魂を揺り醒ますものはまた、宗教以外には無い。そのまた宗教の中で、そうした希望を満たしてしれるものは、大本教以外には無い。と、そこで彼は大本教に入り、忽ちにして熱心な――それはまったく、寝食を忘れるほどに熱心な信者―― 信者というよりも、神霊の有無、神と人との関係、信仰の妙諦、それの探究者となったのである。 昭和三年。東京の商人岡田茂吉は、完全に脱皮して、一人の、神の使徒と更生した。 それからの六年間、彼は物質以外に、天地の霊、宇宙の霊を認め、また神霊による病気治療の確信を、固く把握した。そして大本教の幹部となり、出口王仁三郎師からの深い信頼も得た。しかるにその後出口王仁三郎師から最早や学び取る何ものもなくなったことを知る様になった。 ああ、大本教ももはやおしまいだ！と岡田氏はひそかに心を決し、昭和九年の秋、ついに職を辞して同教団を離れたのであった。果然、その翌年である。大本教が不敬罪のかどで大断圧を吃したのが。 そこで岡田氏は、その昭和九年の五月、東京麹町の平川町に一戸を構え「応神堂」の看板をあげ「信仰的指圧療法」といった意味の治療所を開いた。 さてここで、観音教由来ということになるのだが、大変な奇蹟があらわれた。 それは、ある日、某なる男が訪ねて来たので、自分が床の間に坐っている写真をその男に撮らセ、これを現像してみると、自分の横ッ腹あたりから、もうもうたる、白雲か、霧がみたいなものが立ち昇っていて、その煙のような中に、ありありと、観音菩薩の像が映っているのだ。 「これァなんだ？どうしたんだ、これは」 「さァ不思議ですね」 という騒ぎだ。床の間にも、どこにも、この家に観音さまなぞ、絵も、彫刻もありはせぬ。 「何か、トリックじゃないのか」 「とんでもない。乾板を調べれは、トリックでしたか、どうか、玄人にはすぐ判りますよ」 彼は観音の加護を信じた。やがて、観音の意志を知った。つまり、神はこの自分を用いて、この世の人間苦を救い、光明の世界を現出させようと試みているのだという確信を得た。 信者も相当の数に植えた。みな岡田氏の「信仰的指庄療法」によって、それぞれに病気を治して貰った人々であるが、この信徒を擁して「大日本観音会」というものが出発することとなった。昭和十年一月である。 三 翌年の夏、埼玉県大宮警察から、彼は医師法違反の件で呼び出しをうけた。 太宮の片倉製糸工場で、岡田の弟子の武井某（大日本観音会埼玉支部長）が、女工を何十人か治療したことが引っかかりとなったのだ。むろん武井は留置されている。そこへ岡田氏が呼び出されて、司法主任からイキナリ、 「お前が生き神様か」 と訊かれた。 「いいえ、私はそんなものではないです」 「黙れ！ウソをいうと承知せんぞ。いいか、信者はキサマを生神さまじゃというとる。よし、生き神さまなら罰をあてることが出来るだろう。やってみろ」 そばに立っていた二人の刑事へ、この主任が四角い頤（おとがい）を振ると、ヤニワに二人が、右左から、岡田氏の髪の毛を掴んで引っぱり合いをはじめた。痛い、実に、斬られるよりも痛い。泣きそうになりながら、どうか許してくださいと彼はひらあやまりにあやまった。 「よし、それでも、キサマの写真のことについて訊くが、霊写真とかいうて、観音様の映ったインチキ写真を祭ッとるそうだね」 「インチキではありません」 「ごまかしても駄目だ。あのトリックは、どうしてつくッたのだ。正直に言うてみろッ」 「トリックなぞじャないです、実は、某という男が私を訪ねて来まして、いろいろ宗教上の意見を語り合ったとき、この男が、あとで私を撮影したのです。むろんその男は、写真の方は素人です。ところが焼きつけてみると、その写真が、ああした不思議な現象をみせたんですよ」 ここでまた、例の二人の刑事が、竹刀をふり翳して岡田氏の両側から迫まって来た。 「キサマは図々しいやつだ。正直なことを言わんと腰っ骨をブッ砕いてやるぞ、いいか」 「どうだ、もう一ペン言ってみろ。ハッキリと、どうだ」 うかつには口も利けないと思い、いつまでも眼をつむって黙り込んでいた。すると、トタンに「痛いッ、あ痛イ」と、一人の刑事が頭をかかえて妙な顔をしだした。 「どうした。君」 「急に頭が、割れるようなんだ。変だなァこのインチキ野郎め、罰をあてやがった」 「バカ。神経だよ、バカな」 もう一人の刑事は笑い出したが、その男もまた、妙な顔をし、横腹を圧さえていたが、やがて二人とも、消えるようにその部屋を出て行った。その間に司法主任は調書を書きあげ、これに捺印しろと突き出した。その文面によると、霊観音の写真は、実は私がつくりました美術写真の一種であります、といった意味のことがしるしてある。 異議を称えればまた拷問される。その苦痛がたまらないので、ヤケ気味になり、ええくそっとばかり、それに捺印してしまった。 そしてその日はブタ箱で夜を明かし、翌日は帰宅をゆるされたが、すぐまた、所轄の玉川署に引致され、十二日間をブタ箱に閉じこめられた。彼は当時玉川の畔（ほと）り上野毛に住み、そこで営業していたからである。 ついに治療を禁止された、治療を禁止されては生活することが出来ない。いろいろと歎願運動をし、結極「宗教的」という、その宗教をやめ、単なる治療屋として営業を許されることになったが、それから四年経った昭和十五年に、また玉川署のブタ箱へブチ込まれた。今度は医師法違反。 患者に対し、これは医者にかかる必要はない。わしの治療で完全に治るといい、そして医者に行くことを妨害し、治療を行って治癒せしめた。これ即ち医師法違反なり、というのだった。 この調子ではまたも再び営業禁止だろうと思い、 「病気を治すことが医師法違反と言われるのでしたら、この私の営業は成り立ちません。私はすぐに廃業します」 これは、意地悪い司法主任の、鼻のさきを、パチン！と指で弾じきとばしたような結果となった。営業を禁止するぞ！と脅かすつもりでいたその先手を打たれ、やめますと言い出されたので、主任もポカンとなり、やがて、ムッと怒り、三日ばかりまた、ブタ箱に閉じ込めて置いた。 「おい、おまえは療術行為をやめると言ったな。よし！誓約書を書け。どんなことがあっても、一生涯、コンリンざいやりませんという誓約書だ」 三日後に、ブタ箱から引き出して、主任殿の喧嘩腰だ。よッぽど口惜しかったものと見える。 それから一年経った。警視庁から、療術行為の届出をして貰いたいと言って来た。 弾圧してやめさせた治療行為を、再びやりなさいというのだ。とんでもない話だが、岡田氏にはその内情が読めている。おかしくてたまらない。 そのころの大臣某氏、陸軍大将某、大実業家某々などが、岡田氏のもとに治療を頼んでくる。岡田はそれを刎ねつける。警察から苛められ、昨年限りやめました。いかなるわけがあろうとも、金輪際やりませぬという誓約書を書かされたのですから……。 大臣、軍人、金持、そうした階級の走狗であった警視庁だから、怪しからんじャないか、万人を救う岡田の治療を、なぜ断圧したのだ。バカなことをすると承知せんぞと叱りつけられた警察は、一も二もなくひれひれ伏して、早速ながら「治療行為」をやるという届けを出してくれと、妙な嘆願に及んだしだいなのだ。 四 「信仰」「信」「信は力なり」 「己」「自我」「私」私を無くすること――己れを空しくすること。己れを絶し切った窮極の心に神が宿る。「則天去私」 「神とは、宇宙の精神である。宇宙の精神、即ち神の意志は、これは絶対無限の愛、大いなる愛に他ならぬ」 「宗教は迷信なり。宗教はアヘンなり」というのは「極端な唯物主義者の偏見であり、無学なインテリ大衆の、小児病的なカタコトに過ぎぬ。真実の大宇宙の精神に触れようとするためには、人間は、もっと、もっと学問を高めなくてはならぬ。学問の中でも、特に「スピリチュアリズム――神霊主義を究わめねばならぬ。これは、唯物主義科学に対立するものではなく、その上に在るものだ。より高く、より深い精神的なるものの究極が、宗教となるのだ。それは当然である」 岡田氏の骨を削るような精進工夫が、ついにここにまで到達したとき、彼は豁然として神の啓示を悟った。 もともと彼は、一介の江戸ッ児少年であった。貧しい家に産れ、ただ向学の念に燃える一介の貧書生に過ぎなかった。 決して、将来大宗教家になろうなぞとは、夢にも想ってはいなかった。まして、救世主になろうなぞという野望は、狂人でない彼の、抱き夢みる限界ではなかったのだ。 ただ、あまりにも惨酷な病苦と貧困とが、あわれな、小さな、迷える羊の彼を、自然に――あるいは無理やりに宗教の門へとつれて行ったのである。 そのために、彼は大本教にも入ったし、キリスト教、仏教その他あらゆる宗教の教義を研究もしたのであった。彼は確に天才児であり、秀才であった。また、不撓不屈、おそろしく強靭な意志をも恵まれていた。殆ど人生の半ばを通じて、病床に悲痛な闘病と、苦学をつづけ得たのは、こうした天恵の力を、彼が本質的に恵まれていたからだと云えよう。まったく、異常な、想像以外の闘病と苦学だったらしい。 「岡田茂吉という人物は、あれはあの苦学で大学教授にでも、博士にでもなれた人ですね」 そういうふうに彼を見ている人々もある。その岡田氏は、博士にも教授にもならず、すっかり病魔を駆逐し去ったあげくは、世間からは按摩屋さんとも想われたりしたであろう指圧療法の先生になったのだが、それは彼が、あまりにも強く、烈しく「人間苦」の解決を求めた結果である。 この人世から、病と、貧と、争いとを無くするわけには行かないものか。 明けても暮れてもそれを思った。夢の中でもそれが念頭を去らなかった。それを思い念じることが、彼の生活の全部だったといってもよかった。 病、貧、争、これは輪廻である。三ッ巴である。どれが原因で、どこが結果ということはない。すべてが原因であり、すべてが結果である。国と国との戦争、個人と個人との相克。 彼が生れる前には、永い無明の幕末時代があった。明治のころになっても、国内の攘乱は絶えなかった。西南戦争がその大切解みたいな結果だった。それから日清戦争、日露戦争、第一次欧洲大戦、日華紛攘、満州事変、日華事変――。 彼の父母は、否、日本の大衆は、こうした戦乱紛争のさなかに痩せ衰えて行ったのだ。彼の両親が貧乏だったのも、その貧民の児の彼が病弱だったのも、すべては戦争が元だといえないだろうか。 借金をする人々、夜逃げをする人々。自殺する人々、肉親同志の喧嘩、他人同志の憎み合い、すべては貧が源である。あるいは病気が因である。しかし、貧、病は戦争の結果である。否、貧病が源で戦争、喧嘩が起るのだ。イヤそうではない――どこまで行っても、この輪廻には始めも終りもありはしない。 宗教、そうだ！宗教こそは、この闘、病、貧を払拭し去ってくれるものだ。と思いはしても、日本の宗教は戦争を援助していた。武運長久、敵国撃滅の護符を、さかんに売り出し、また盛大な祈祷をして兵士を戦場に送り出した。 将兵もまた、神や仏に祈りを捧げながら、勝ってくるぞと勇ましく、殺人、暴虐の首途をして行くのだった。 そうして、地球を血に染め、死屍を戦野に充満させ、悪疫と貧困で国土を枯疫させるのだった。 そうした現実をみて、岡田茂吉いかに秀才なりといえども、自己一身の名のために、大学教授や博士になりすまし、安閑としてはいられないのであった。ここに、彼の持って生れた《宿命》が潜在していたのである。 彼は異常な情念を産みつけられていた。この異常な情念がまた、異常な情熱を彼の体内に燃焼させた。そしてこの異常な情熱が、彼の場合は偉大な《誠実》となり、偉大な《人間愛、社会愛》に膨張したのであった。 今日の岡田氏は、甚だ恬淡にして洒々落々たる風貌、言行の士であり、私は難行苦行をしてこの宗法を弘通しようとしてはいない。すべては神任せだ。神が私という人間を必要とし、道具として私を使用しているのだから、私自身は極めて明るく楽しいのだ、と言っているが、それはそうだろう。現在においての彼の心境は、あるいはそうだろうが、しかし彼が、初めて神の啓示を大悟するまで、その以前にあっての彼の人間苦と惨澹たる思索の過程は、けだし想像に余るものがあったのだ。 何度自殺しようと考えたか。病苦のために、貧困のために、また人間悪、社会悪のために。思想を抱いているのは肉体である。霊、肉不二。即身、即仏。肉体が清浄となれは、霊の曇も頂き払われる。もしも、飢えたる肉体に美味な食物を給与することが出来たら？もしも、苦患の肉体を無病の神身に保証してやることが出来たら？もしも憎悪、闘争に憔悴しつつある人間に、無闘争の社会を与えてやることが出来たら？ それは出来るか？ あるいは不可能のことだろうか？ 神！ そうだ神によってのみ可能だ。すべては神の意志なのだ。 病苦も、修羅の苦も、神の意志にほかならぬ。 船が進む方向から、逆の風が吹いてくる。人間が生きて行こうとする真向いから、諸悪諸業が吹きつけてくる。 しかし船は、その逆風に対向して帆を張りあげる。帆は逆風を孕み、これを巧みに辷らせることによって、その逆風を利用し、却って船の推進力に変化させる。 そうだ！俺は神に向って帆を張ろう。と彼が思いついたとき、神はすでに彼の身心を帆としてその中に降臨していた。 彼の身に、彼を呆然自失させるような奇蹟が相続いで示現されだした。 幸福な人生を造りたい、われも人も。社会は天国のような楽園でありたい。この願い以上に、彼は何も望みはしなかった。別に、大聖者たらむとも、大宗教家、大救世主にならうとも、そうした野望は持ってはいなかった。警察の度び重なる断圧に嫌気がさし、ついに治療行為をやめたのが、昭和十五年の暮だった。岡田氏ときに五十九歳。 キリストも釈迦も再び生れ来よ 汝と吾れの力試さん 善きことを悪しと見らるゝ世にあつて 何とかせんや懐手すも 和歌の如き感想を発表して、ひたすら本教と、門弟の養成に邁進した。 その養成された多くの使徒たちのうちでも、渋井、中島などという人は錚々たるもので、渋井氏は「みろく会」を、中島氏は「天国会」を、それぞれ主宰して師岡田の下に従属した。 この国は無法な侵略戦争に突入し、敗色は日とともに色濃くなって来た。 十九年の初夏、観音教は箱根の強羅に、藤山愛一郎氏の別荘を買って疎開したが、その秋には、熱海で、山下亀三郎氏の別荘を買い、そこに引移った。いよいよ敗戦決定の二十年八月、彼は、呆然自失の信者たちを前に、 「これでいいんだ。日本が真に正しい国となる時機に到達したのである。ヤクザ日本が泥足を洗って堅気な日本に更正するのだ。神が、アメリカの手を借りてこの国に覚醒の大鉄槌を加え給うたのである」 と説いた。今日ならば誰にでも頷ける言葉だが、敗戦決定の当日、この言葉を聞かされた信者どもは、やはり呆然として、精神喪失者みたいな表情を傾けるばかりだった。 とにかく、こうした考え方をしている岡田氏だから、戦争中はいろいろな手で、警察から苛められ通したものである。 「お前の方で、病気を治すのは、観音さまのごりやくじャない。天皇陛下の御稜威で治るのじャ。だから病気が治った者は、二重橋のところへお礼に行け」 そんなことを言ってくる特高巡査もあった。熱海ではまた、三台あったラジオセットを悉く警察に没収された。アメリカと短波で何か通信し合っているというのだ。 いつも教団本部の前の家には刑事が張込んでいて、出入の信者をリストに記録した。 「岡田のやつ、なンとかして引ッくくってやろうと思うが、どうもうまく行かン。観音教は、是が非でも叩き潰してやりたんいだ。しかし、いくらやってみても、引ッくくる材料がなくて困っとるンじャ」 某警察署長が、新聞記者に、そんな述懐をもらしたこともあったという。 検察当局を苛々させながらも、観音教はしだいに発展し、世の智識階層を苦笑させるような奇蹟が、その何十万人という信者たちの上に、枚挙のいとまもないほどに顕現した。 インテリ階級は、この奇蹟を「偶然」だという。偶然とは、たまたま、稀に見る、思いもよらぬ事象の意味である。偶然が枚挙にいとまのないほど発生したのでは、もはやこれは、偶然ではなくて必然だろう。 ともかく、観音教は、信者三十万という大勢力に膨張して「世界救世教」と発展した。 「おい、メシヤ教は三十万の信者を擁しているそうだ。実にケシカラン」 「莫大なお賽銭をもて余し、熱海の山にパラダイスなぞを造営しているというぜ、まったく怪しからン。早く叩き潰さにャいかンね」 偏執狂じみたインテリ大衆の呪い。 この声に、国法の正しい運営を任務とする検察当局が耳をかたむけた。猛然崛起した。 いよいよ熱海の五・八事件突発となったしだいである。 法 難 いわゆる「法三章」で、法は僅か三章で足りる。むしろそれが理想なのだ。あるいは、三章をすら不必要とするのが窮極の理想である。政治の運営さえよろしければ……。 元来、法規はわれわれ俗人が、俗物の代議士を議会に送って立法させたもの、しこうしてまたわれわれが、われわれの公僕をしてこれを行使せしめているものである。 俗人がこさえて、俗吏が運営する法規である以上、法律というものは、神がつくって神これを行うところの天の摂理と比べては、遥に不完全かつ不規則なものに相違ない。いくら何万章の法をつくつてみても。だから、検察の局に当るものは、よくよくこの道理を弁まえ、自我を殺し、感情を滅し、ひたすら謙譲に、戦々兢々としてこれを行使しなくてはならぬということ、いまさら言を要しないところの常識である筈なのに――それなのに、静岡県の当局は一たい、どういう常識でなにを検顕しようとして、莫大な国民の税金を、このメシヤ教検挙に費消し、そうして如何なる収獲を、その結果に得たというのか！ あれだけの人と金と時とを費すのならば、もっと他に、やって貰いたい緊急のことが山ほどもあったのに――と今にしては、呆れている人々の方が多い。 去る昭和二十五年五月八日に始まり、同七月十二日までに一段落を見た、このメシヤ教検挙事件について、岡田氏はその著書「法難手記」で、大要次の如く語っている。 ―――――――――――――――――――― 警察官並びに検事の取調べは、到底想像だも出来ない程の、非民主的のものであった。若しかくの如き不合理が許されるとしたら、今後如何に多くの無辜の人民が災いせられ、苦難を被るかは、計り知れないものがあろう。如何に完璧なる憲法が制定されたとしても、その運営がこれに伴わないとすれば、折角得た自由も民主々義も、泥に踏み躙られる結果となるであろう。吾々は専門家ではないが、そもそも法の建前なるものは、善を勧め悪を懲らし、よりよき社会を作り、最大多数の最大幸福を実現する。それが基本的信念であらねばならぬと惟うのである。私は御承知の如く一宗教人ではあるが、宗教の本来も、よりよき人類社会の実現を目標とし、善を勧め悪を懲らし、理想世界を作るにあるのは言を俟たないのである。したがって、吾等が如何に宗教弘通に専念し、自由民主主義社会を企図するといえども、法の運営に当る人たちが、それに無理であるとしたら、これに覚醒を促がし、正しき認識の下に所期の目的を達せられん事を願望するのである。それがための一資料が些かなりとも、役立つとすれは、幸甚この上なき次第である。とは言うものの、省みれば、吾等といえども今回の事件によって、今までの経営が如何に杜撰放漫を極め、監督不行届であったかは、まことに自責の念に堪えないものがある。若し今回の事件なかりせば、放漫は不知不識の中に、幾多災いの種を蒔いたかも知れなかったので、大難が小難で済んだと思ったのである。全く神が当局の手を煩わして、一大粛正の思慮を垂れ給うたと信じ、今回の大いなる苦難も、神の愛の鞭でなくて、何であろうと深く省み、只々感謝感激あるのみである。 この意味においては、その鞭の役目を荷われた、当局者の労苦に対しても、深甚なる感謝を捧ぐるのである。 この著の題名を法難手記としたが、これを実際から言えば当らないかも知れない。と言うのは、彼の基督にしろ、日蓮、法然、親鸞、近くは天理教々祖にしろ、その開祖教祖が未だ現行の如き法のない時代であったに拘わらず、法難の言葉を用いられて来たのであるが、この法の意味は、今日の法律の法でばなく、仏教から出た言葉であろう。それは仏教の最初は仏法と呼ばれ、中途から仏教に転化したのであるから、この意味に於て、キリストの如きは法難ではなく、受難というべきであろう。 そうして私の今何の事件は、宗教上は何等関係がなく、単なる脱税問題が主であったから、法難ではなく法律難と言うのが妥当であろう。これは別の話ではあるが、天理教々祖中山ミキ刀自は、投獄さるる事十数何に及んだという事である。にも拘らず、今日の如き、隆昌を見るに到った事は、宗教に法難は附物であって、官憲が如何に強圧するといえども真に価値あるものなれば、決して挫折する事なく、いつかは社会から、認められるようになる事を知るのである。 次に、本著の目的について、今一つの重要事がある。御承知の如く、今度の事件発生するや、大抵の新聞紙には、特ダネ扱いに大々的に報道されたが、その記事を読んでみると、随分出鱈目が多いので、社会を誤るの甚しきを憂い、一応の弁明をなす必要あるを思うのである。 大手入れ 昭和二十五年五月八日未明、突如として青天の霹靂のごとく、本教関係の熱海所在の建物六カ所、小田原一カ所、、合計七カ所に対し、一大家宅捜索が行われた。その際動員された警官、無慮八十名というのであるから、いかに大仕掛であったかが判るのである。 ちょうど暁の大捕物という形だ。しかも全員ピストル携帯、物々しい出立ちは、最近行われたボスの、大親分検挙を思わしむるものがある。誰か、宗教団体がこのような扱いを受けるなどと、想像されたであろう。 終戦前、彼の大本教や、人の道教等が、大弾圧を喫したその記憶は、未だ吾等の頭にも残っているが、その頃の宗教関係事件と言えば、殆んどは、不敬罪と婦人関係で、これが通り相場のようになっていた。しかし不敬罪は、今日跡方もなく消えてしまったし、エロ問題も本教に限ってない事は、世間誰でも知っている。とすれば一体全体何の容疑なのか、全然見当がつかない。ただ不思議というより外はない。そこで捜査の遣り方によって、判断するより外に考えようがないから、家人や立会った人達に詳しく聞いてみた。 まず、五月八日午前五時三十分、私は急に眼が醒めた。すると台所の方で、何か騒がしい音がすると思うや、一人の女中が慌ただしく部屋へ入って来た『今警察の方が大勢見えて調べに来たと言うのです』私は驚くと共に不思議で堪らない。次の間に寝ていた妻はソッと襖を開け、私に近寄り小声で『あなた泥棒じゃないですか？』と言う。私は『真暗な夜中ならとにかく、夜が明けた今そんな筈はない確かに警察官だよ』と言うか言わない内、早次の間へ入つて来たらしい気配がする。慌てて次の間へ引っ返した妻は、まだ信じられないと見え、相手に向って『あなたは泥棒じゃありませんか？』といっている。『イヤ、僕はこういう者だ』と令状をみせたらしい。妻は『それではどうぞお調べ下さい』という。私は事態容易ならずと床を蹴って襖を開けてみると、 なるほど警官らしい一人が、キョロキョロ辺りを見廻している。彼は私に対って〃起きるには及ばん、寝ていなさい〃というので、私も寝てた方が捜査に都合がいいのだろうと察して床に入ったが、胸がドキドキして眠る処ではない。しかし別に家宅捜索されても心配の点は些かも無いのだが、落着けないのは人間誰もがもつ、共通心理であると思ったりした。私は朝飯の仕度が出来たので起床し、不味いのを我慢しながら一杯で済ました。心配事があると何よりも食事に影響する事がつくづく思われた。その時乗り込んで来た私服は、十二三人であった事を後から聞いた。それから彼等は家中隅なく捜査し、書類やら郵便物、銀行通帳、現金及び数百枚の名刺等々、調査資料になりそうな物は、悉く押収して引揚げたのである。何でも後で聞いた女中の話によると、六畳の女中部屋を六七人の警官が、三時間もかかって調べたのだという。もっとも数人の女中の行李であるから、相当品数はあったであろうが、何しろ腰巻からズロース迄も一枚一枚丹念に調べたというのだから推して知るべきだ。役人何れも〃変だな、ヘンだな〃を連呼していたそうである。察するに大きな期待をかけていた隠匿物が見当らなかったからであろう、とは誰もが語り合った話である。総勢引揚げたのは午後三時頃であったから、食事の時間を差引いても悠に八時間に及んだ訳である。 右は私の住宅であるが、熱海清水町にある別院のごときは、押入の根太を外して縁の下迄調べたそうであるから、いかに大きな期待をかけて来たかが判るのである。又私の旧住宅である熱海東山の家には金庫があったが、長い間使わなかったため、番号を覚えている者がいないので、開ける事が出来ず封印をして帰り、その後数日経って三人の警吏が来て漸く開けたが、何もなかったので大いに失望して帰ったとの事を、留守番から聞いたのである。その後五月三十日箱根強羅の別院へ、総勢五十人の警吏が乗込んで、数時間に渉って頗る綿密な捜索を行った由であるが、この時は私は抑留中であったため、後で聞いたのである。 以上のような大々的家宅捜索が行われたに拘わらず、泰山鳴動式に終ったのであるが、しかし考えれば考える程、どういう訳でこのような大掛りな捜査をしたかと言う事である。実に判らない。みんなの一致した観方は、余程の隠匿物資があるとみて来たらしいという。ところが令状には金久平に関する贈賄容疑としてあるので、それ位の容疑で武装警官八十人とはいよいよもって判らない。しかもその時私の秘書井上福夫、造営部熱海主任金久平の二人まで逮捕留置されたというのである。 このような訳で、当局の意図なるものはサッパリ見当がつかない。それだけ何かしら穏かならぬものを感じない訳にはゆかない。もちろん井上も金も弁護士を頼んだのであるが、それから私の身の上を心配した信者の誰彼は、知合の弁護士を頼んでくれたり、連れて来たりして慰めてくれた。なお、これ以上進展するかもしれないという観念からその対策を相談した事もあった。というのは井上も金も二三日で帰るだろうと思ったのに、一週間経ち二週間経っても帰らない。井上にしろ金にしろ大した犯罪など犯すような人間でない事は、永い間部下として使った経験によっても明かである。殊に井上の如きは二十年前から忠実に仕えており、今日は家族同様の待遇さえ与えていたからである。 右の両人が引張られる余程前から、信者である銀行員山田仁太郎が抑留されている事を聞いたが、罪状は浮貸問題とかであった。同氏は以前は時々来たが、今年になってからは、一回面会しただけで、御無沙汰勝ちとなっていたので、彼の事情については、知る由もないが、彼とても信者である以上、それ程間違った事を、する筈がないと思ったが、これもサッパリ見当がつかない。又こういう説をする者もあった。それは例のユスリの一団が当局を動かしたのではないかというのである。ここでこのユスリ団を、詳しくかく必要があろう。 強 請 団 このユスリ団というのは、一、二年前から本教団を狙っており、目的は、巨額の金銭を拝得しようとして、あの手、この手の策略を用いて、教団を執拗に揺ぶるのである。噂によると国会議員数人を初め、宗教人、旧右翼系の利者、本教の反対者等々、少くとも十人内外の者が一団となって謀略を廻らし、当局はもとより司令部方面に迄働きかけ、本教団を伏魔殿のように思わしめ、結局解散一歩手前に迄追いつめておいて、それを免がれるには巨額の運動費が必要であると持ちかけ、何千万円の大金をせしめようと、企んでいると言うのである。そうして右の計画を達成するための宣伝としては、本教は医学を誹謗するとか、無肥料栽培は、怪しからぬなどと言い、脱税問題、贈賄問題等その他種々の捏造やデマを絡ませ、特に彼等が力を注いでいるのは、物資隠匿である。ヤレ金塊やダイヤモンド、何億を隠匿しているとか言うのだから、当局を刺戟するには絶好の資料である。その他新聞雑誌を悪用し、デマを飛ばし世論を作り、世論からみて本教の存在がいかにも、社会に害あるごとく思わしむる等、あらゆる苦肉の手段を弄し、目的を達しなければ止まないというような気構えであった。その現われの一つとして昨年夏ＣＩＤの大袈裟な手入れがあった。忘れもしない八月二十五日夜九時頃、箱根強羅別院に千人程の部員が突如家宅捜索に来たのである。容疑は多量の金塊、白金及びダイヤモンドを、ドラム缶一杯に入れて隠匿しているというのである。それが頗る確信に満ちているようで二日に渉って厳重なる家宅捜索をなし、最後にはレーダー迄も使用し、住宅の床下の土まで掘起した程であったに拘わらず、この時も泰山鳴動して鼠一匹も出なかったので、事なく済んだが、訊いてみると密告と投書によったと言うのである。彼等ユスリ団がこのように官憲を欺瞞し、躍らせる巧妙さは感嘆に堪えないのである。かように私利の為に罪なき良民を苦しめても、何ら法の制裁を受ける事なく、公然として社会を横行し、良民がいつも被害を受け泣寝入りに終るのであるから、善人は損をし、悪人は得をするという結果になるので、全く法の制度か又は運営に欠陥があるのか、ともかく軽視出来ない問題である。今回の家宅捜索がＣＩＤの手入れの当時を知っている人々の多くは、隠匿物資の疑いの点が余りによく似ていると話し合っているのを私は聞いたのである。 前述のごとく、信者が紹介したり、連れて来た弁護士達が、いかに何でも明主様が引張られるような事は、万あるまいという意見の方が多かった。そんな訳で私としても、呼び出し位の事はあるかも知れないが、拘留などは絶対ないと安心していたのである。ところが五月二十九日、家宅捜索のあった八日の日から数えて二十一日目の二十九日未明、就寝中の私は突如起された。見ると静岡県清水市庵原警察署、刑事部長Ｋ氏という名刺を出し、一人の刑事を伴い、私に対って「直ちに同行されたい」と言うので、私は愕然とした。余りに意外であったからである。その時私はこう言った。〃部下が長い間取調べを受けているのは、何か氷解しない点があるからであろう。それで一度私の口から充分説明したら解るだらうと思っていたので、ちょうどよい〃と快諾した。途中自動車の故障などがあって大分遅延したが、零時半警察署の門をくぐり、留置所へ入れられたのである。留置所の経験は昭和十一年二回、同十五年一回あったが、一回目は二日、二回目は十一日、三回目は三日間であつた。一、二回共宗教問題で、三回目は医師法違反でいずれも無罪であった。当時の調べは三回共特高であったが、特高の調べなどというと、非常に封建的であるように想像されるが、今回の取調べに較べてみると、比較にならぬ程、今度の方が峻厳苛烈で、戦慄の一語につきると言ってもいい。 最初の取調べ 警察に拘留された一日目は、簡単な取調べで終ったが、第二日目であった。朝飯を済ますや直ちに二階の調室に連れられた。Ｋ刑事部長、Ｍ刑事部長の二人の外に、Ｓ警部という人が応援として、静岡市国警本部からこの朝出張して来たと言われた。ここで右の三人に就て感じたままをかいてみるが、Ｋ氏はどちらかといえは、物柔かい親しみ易い人であったが、Ｍ氏はいかにも調べ役人型で峻烈である。まずＭ氏は親父型、Ｋ氏は女房型と言つてよかろう。Ｓ警部は頑丈な軍人タイプの人で、迫力があり被告は威圧される感じである。 いよいよ、取調べは始まった。私を取囲んで三人は代る代る訊問を始めた。最初は静岡銀行沼津支店、行員山田仁太郎氏に関する件であったが、正直に言えいうので、知っている事は知っている、知らない事は知らないというと、三人は声を揃えて『君は知らない筈はない。呆気たり、嘘を言ったりすると承知せんぞ、井上の言う事も、山田の言う事も一致している以上、君ひとり違うと言っても、二対一では君の方が間違っているに決っている』と一喝された。私は『いくら考えても私の方が本当だと思う』と言うと、三人は納得せす、どこ迄も追及する。私は驚いた。これが民主警察の調べ方だろうか、これでは民主的どころかおよそ逆である。これに較べれば昔の特高の調べ方の方がどの位楽だったか判らない。いかに有りのままを言っても、テンデ相手にしてはくれない。御自分の方の主張をあく迄通そうとする。これは大変な事だ。どう言っていいか私には判らない。私は調べられているんじゃない、命令されているんだ。正直に言う事それは将に命令違反でしかない。私は苦し紛れに作り事を言いましょうかと言うと、彼等は『そんな馬鹿な事はいかん。正直に言いさえすれはいいのだ』と言う。と言って正直に言えは全然取り合わない。およそ世の中にこんな矛盾撞着な話があるであろうか、嗚呼神よ、自分はどうすれはいいのだとただ溜息をつくばかりだ。一体こんな取調べ方はいつから始まったんだろうか、最初から罪人として扱い、罪人にしてしまうのがソ連のやり方という事をかつて聞いた事がある。しかし民主日本の今日の警察がそれと同じような事はある筈がないと思うが、今日の前の現実はそれではないか。そんな事を考える暇にも三人の怒号は耳が割れんばかりだ。そんな訳で私はよく覚えていないが、不得要領の陳述でともかくその日の取調べは終ったが、恐らく調書は杜撰極まるものであったであろう。 次の日も前日のごとく、三氏から同一の問題について調べられたが、前日と同様明確な供述は出来よう筈がないので取調べはサッパリ進捗しない。彼等は益々焦ら立ち攻めたてる。ある時は語気荒く、あるときは静かになるというように、鬼になったり仏になったり端倪すべからざるものがある。その時フト頭に浮んだのは、終戦後アメリカ指導の下に民主日本となるや、被告といえども罪が決定する迄は罪人扱いをしないという事を聞いていたが、現実はあまりにも違うではないか、ここは最初から罪人扱いだ。不肖私といえども信徒三十万から崇敬されている一宗の教組である。ところがどうだ。その扱い方は現行犯で引っ張られた刑事被告人と何等択ぶところはない。なるほど以前と違うところは言葉つきの些か丁寧になった事だ。「貴様」「お前」は使わない、ただそれだけである。私はこの時程昔の調べ方が恋しいと思った事はなかった。そうして今の取り調べ方で最も苦痛なのは、遮二無二記憶を呼び起せという記憶訊問である。なるほど自分が直接ふれた事か又は承認を与えた事なら、何とか記憶を呼び起せない事もないが、全然私の知らぬ間に部下が任意に行った事や、報告の際主要なるものは聞くようにしているが、忙しい時は聞き漏らしもあり、大抵な事は聞いてもすぐ忘れてしまうのである。 ここで私の性格と日常生前をかく必要があろう。私の性格は小さい事は人委せで、万事大局を掴んで事を処理するのである。それでなくては到底大規模な経営は出来るものではない。当時私は週刊新聞と月刊雑誌を発行し、編集は殆んど私一人でやっていた。まず記事の八、九割は私のかいたものと校正した投書や寄書である。その他単行本は一カ年教程を著述刊行していた。熱海及び箱根には百人以上の労務者を使役し、大規模な地上天国の模型を造らしている。言う迄もなく設計も様式も私一人が考案して指示していた。寸暇があれはお守や依頼された書体等一カ月数千枚はかくのである。信者の面会は月六回の休の外、毎日一時間ないし一時間年位数百人から、多い時は千人以上に及ぶ事さえある。それら信徒に対し質問応答並びに講話を聞かせるのである。又教団の幹部及び知名の士や有力者、新聞雑誌記者等、特殊の人達数人以上に面接している。時々東京へ行く事もあるがこれは一日掛りである。日刊新聞教種及び読みたい雑誌は目を通す事にしているが、私は老眼だから毎晩部下に読ませている。又私は若い頃から映画が非常に好きなので、信者は私を慰めるべく各会順繰に奉仕し、月に数回は別院の広間で映画の会を催すのである。勿論勤労奉仕者十人の慰安のためもある。又私はラジオは好きであり、出来るだけ聴くようにしているがラジオだけ聴く事はない。何かしら仕事をしながら聴くので二元的である。それ程私は時間を惜しむのである。ザットかいただけでこれ位であるからいかに多忙を極めているかが判るであろう。私は常に人にて十人前の仕事をしているというが、これはあえて誇張とは思わない。 このような私の多忙生活であるから、金銭上の事など全部部下に委せきりで、日にどの位の収入があるのか、どの位支出があるのか聞いた事もないのである。また私は生神様のごとく、信者から崇敬されている以上、金銭などに関心を持つなどはその必要がないのみか、反って品位を落す事にもなるから特に触れないようにしている。これはひとり私ばかりではあるまい。世間何宗といえどもその開祖教主たるものは金銭は勿論、俗事から超越しているのが通例である。このような訳で経済面やその他に関し時々大体の報告を聞く位で、金高の非常に多い場合とか、金銭以外特殊のものは参考として聞くだけで信仰以外の俗事には殆んど耳を傾けないようにしている。 それだのに何ぞや、私に対して調官の取調べは、宗教上に関する点は一言もなく、専ら経済に関するもののみである。したがっていかに記憶を呼び起せと言っても不可能である事は判りきった話である。調官といえどもそれを知らないはずはないと思うが、どこ迄も経済に関するもののみを執拗に繰返し追及するので、私はその真意を解するに苦しんだ。調官はこういうのでゐる『君は教団の総帥である以上金銭上の事についても知らない筈はない。第一それを知らないとすれば無責任極まるじゃないか』と攻めるから、私は『商事会社の社長ではないから、そんな事は答えられない。しかし仮に社長であっても、税金や会計上の事は専任の部下が責任をとる事になっていて、社長は責任を負わない事になっている』と聞いている。いわんや宗教の教主たるにおいてをやである。しかるに何ぞや教祖の私を掴えては経済面のみを執拗に訊問するのは前述の通りである。その都度私は、商事会社の社長とは違うから宗教上に関した事ならいかようにも答えるが経済面は無理であると言うと『そんな事はあるもんか、君は何でも部下に罪を被せようとする、実に卑怯だ。教祖たるものは部下の罪も引受けるのが当り前じゃないか』と言うのであるから開いた口が塞らない。これでは宗教家が警察官から御説教を聞かされる訳だ。私は彼等の余りの無理解に憤怒がこみあげてくるのを、彼等の感情を害しては損だと思い、又これも神の試錬とも解してじっと我慢し、虫を殺して平身低頭ひたすら御気嫌を損じないよう、これ努めた事は一再ならずであった。 Ｓ警部は二三日で帰ってしまった。後はＫ氏とＭ氏の両人が、自分の仕事の合間合間に根気よく取調べたのである。少ない時でも一日数時間に及んだであろう。いつも取調べを始める前、Ｍ氏は決まって一クサリのお説教をする。その言う事はいつも同じであるが、Ｍ氏は気がつかないらしい。それはこうである『君も一日も早く帰りてえだろうし、数人の部下も長い間牢屋に入っているし、早く出してやりてえだろうから、速かに記憶を呼び起して残らず話してしまった方がいいぜ』と言う。またこんな事を言った事もある。『こんな判りきった事件の記憶を呼び起せねえ筈はねえ、殺人強盗でさえ五年も前の事でもよく覚えていてスラスラ白状するのに、君のは僅か二年前の事なんだ、覚えがねえ訳はねえ、これじゃ神様か何か知らねえが、殺人強盗にも劣るじゃねえか」とこんな調子である。余りの侮辱に私は情なさに涙が込みあげて来るのをどうする事も出来なかった。その時私は思った。なるほど殺人強盗のような異常な行為は、五年前は愚か十年否一生忘れる事は出来まい、しかし私のは全然無根の事だから忘れるとか忘れないとかの問題ではない。彼はこんな判りきった事さえ判らないのか、判らない振りをするのかとにかく追及は益々烈しくなる。彼は度々こうも言った。「君が記憶を呼び起さなければ呼び起さないでもいいよ、僕の方はちっとも困りゃしねえからな、けれどそれじゃ君の方が損じゃねえか、だからまあ記憶を呼び起すまで幾日でもいて貰うんだな――早く記憶を呼び起してちっとでも早くここを出た方が利巧だよ、よく考え給え」とも言うのである。 記憶の捏造 これを聞かされる毎に私は気が気じゃない。どうしたらいいのだろう。全然ない記憶を呼び起せと言っても無理だし、呼び起さなければ幾日でも留置されるとしたら、何とかしなければならない。こんな苦しみをするくらいなら以前に何か少しくらい悪い事をしておけばよかった。そうすればそれを白状したら済むがなあとそんな事まで思った。私は考えに考えた末、ここに一つの方法を考え出した。それは記憶の捏造だ、つまり記憶を呼び起したらしく作為する事だ。これが彼の言う利巧というものだろう。そこで私は恐る恐るそうしてみた。彼は丸キリ違うと言って取合わない。また私は考えた。彼の言葉の端から幾分ずつでも嗅ぎ出して作ってみようと思い、色々引出そうとしたが彼は誘導訊問になるから駄目だと言う。仕方なしに私は彼の顔色を窺い窺い言葉の端に注意しながら僅かずつ作り上げ、曲りなりにも調書が出来たのである。その時私は世にも不思議な事を自分はするのだと思った。警察官の前で自分自身で無実の罪を作るべく苦心惨澹すると言うのだからだ。私はこんな不合理な事が文化国家に有り得るものだろうか、こんな変な骨の折れる事はかつて思ってみた事も聞いた事もない。彼は罪になりそうな陳述をすると満足そうであるが、そうでない陳述は仲々受入れようとしない。しかし私は罪を作るにしても手加減をした。まず一項目に一つか二つくらいなるべく罪が軽くて済むように作為して述べたのである。出てから弁護士に聞いてみると、素人の悲しさ作り方が実にまずいと言われたのである。私の調書をみればそうなっているからよく判るはずだ。また彼は常に語気荒くほとんど喋舌り続けで私には喋舌らせようとしない。これには実に困った。私が喋舌ろうとすると大声で打消してしまう。仕方なく私は彼の喋舌り続ける隙を窺っては僅かずつ陳述したのである。そんな事が数日間続いた。その頃Ｋという検事が出張して来て私を取調べた。ところがＫ検事はインテリ型でその訊問は穏やかで話がよく判り私は救われたような気がした。そのためスラスラ喋舌る事が出来たが、困った事には検事の訊問事項と警察官のそれと同一であるから、警察官に答えた事はその通り言わなければならない。しかしその時の私はもう嘘を言ってしまったんだからどうにでもなれという、半ば棄鉢気分も手伝ってある程度検事の気に入りそうに作為した事は言うまでもない。それから二、三日後応援検事と言うＹ氏が来て訊問されたが、これも大体警官に答えたと同様な陳述をした。Ｙ検事は仲々辛辣に突込んで来たが、どうやらこうやら辻棲を合せて曲りなりにも調書が出来たので私はホッとした。Ｙ検事は数日後再び来られ、取調べを受けたが、前同様であったのはもちろんである。 頭脳の拷問 ここで特筆すべき事が起った。それはＭ氏とＫ氏との両氏から調べられた時の事である。この時は主にＭ氏が訊問に当ったが、昭和二十三年十一月八日に始まった脱税問題に対する運動費の件が主であった。私は全然記憶にないから答える事が出来ないと言うと、Ｍ氏はどうしても承知しない。例の記憶を呼び起せを繰返すのである。彼は時々用事のため席を外すが少時にして戻り「まだ記憶を呼び起せねえか」と催促する。私は例のごとく捏造答弁をするが、何しろ数字の問題なので丸きり桁が違うとか、問題にならぬとか言っては撥ね返されてしまう。彼は言う、「こんな判り切った問題が記憶を呼び起せねえなんて事はあるもんか、正直に言えば何でもねえのに曲げて言おうとするから暇が掛かるんだ」などというので、私は腹が立って仕方がない。私は曲げたり嘘を言ったりする考えは毛頭ない。私も宗教家である以上、常に信徒に対（むか）って虚言を最も戒めているにみて、自分から嘘を言うはずがないではないか、第一神様に対しても虚偽りを言う事は出来ないと説明するが何の反響もない。丸で石地蔵に物を言ってるようなものだ。しかし彼は相変らず記憶を呼び起せの一点張りである。訊問が数字なので作為は実に困難だ。私は焦慮、煩悶、憤怒、絶望等の感情が交錯し、頭脳は困惑の極に達した。グラグラと周囲一面大きな渦巻となった。烈しい眩暈（めまい）が起り、視覚はなくなり、意識は朦朧として気が狂いそうだと思う一瞬、人事不省となってその場に昏倒してしまった。幸い一、二分にして気がついたが、烈しい眩量は耐えられない程で、嘔吐さえ催すのである。仕方なく彼らも取調べを止めた。一時間余経ってどうやら起上る事が出来たので、杖に縋ってようやく留置所内に辿り入る事が出来た。入るやその刹那、留置所が天国のように思えた。普通ならアノ窓の小さな、薄暗い鉄の牢屋格子が嵌められている留置所など想うさえゾッとするのに、それが天国に思えたのはいかに取調べが恐ろしかったかが判るであろう。すると数時間経った頃勾留後十日目の今日初めて弁護士が面会に来た。もっとも最初から接見禁止であったからである。私がフラフラしていて顔色が悪いのでたずねられたから、先刻昏倒した事など話すと、ともかく医師に診て貰いなさいと言うので私も承知した。間もなく警察医が来て診断を受けたが、脳神経衰弱との事であった。 ここで特に言いたい事は、勾留十日以上に及ぶと非常に衰弱するものである。何しろ食欲減退、運動不足、生活の激変、環境の不快感、取調べの苛烈による精神的苦悩等々、馴れないものは、誰しも極度の神経衰弱に陥ってしまうそうである。しかも私は数え年六十九歳の高齢であり、平素から不自由のない生活をしているので、弱り方も特にはなはだしいのである。 翌日、午後になって半分くらい快復した時、再び呼び出され、取調べを受けたがこの時は先方も加減したせいか、どうやら無事に済んだのである。ところがその翌日は一層恢復したので呼び出され訊問を受けたが、この時またまた一昨日の運動費の件が蒸し返された。私はまだ記憶は呼び起せないと言うと、彼らは承知せず相変らず記憶呼び起せの一点張りで責め立てる。余りの執拗さに私は憤怒、懊悩、焦慮などの感情が勃発しようとするのを一生懸命抑えつけようとした。すると苦悩困惑は頭の中でまた渦を巻き始めた。俄然一昨日通りの無意識となり昏倒してしまった。むしろ前回よりもひどかったくらいである。気がついてから身体が痺れたようで、立とうとするとどうしても立てない。一時間余経てようやく立つ事だけは出来たが歩行する事が出来ない。するとＭ氏は見兼ねて私を背負い、留置所内まで運んでくれたが、背負われながら私は思わず叫んだ、「これは頭脳の拷問だ」と言った。拷問の言葉に彼らはギョッとしたらしい。それ以来眩暈は一層はなはだしくなり、ちょっと何か考えようとするとグラグラとする、私は確かに頭脳のどこかが壊れたような気がする。これは大変だ、というのは、もし今一度例の運動費問題で攻められるとしたら、今度は完全に頭脳は破壊されてしまうだろう。その結果、発狂か痴呆症かどちらかは免れまい。あるいは一生涯廃人同様になるかも知れないという無気味な予感が襲って来て仕方がない。そこで翌日は取調べに呼び出されたが私は拒否したのである。と言ってグズグズしてもいられない。一刻も早く取調べが済まなければ出る事が出来ないからである。絶体絶命とはこれである。すると天の助けか浮び出たのが昔旺（さか）んに行った事のある交霊術である。そうだこれより外にこの難関を切抜ける手段はあり得ない。ところでこの難関の焦点は金銭の問題である。それは浅井哲夫氏がほとんど担当していたので同氏が詳しく知っているはずだ。だから同氏の霊を呼び寄せればいいと思い、夜の静寂を機としまず哲夫氏の霊を呼び出して試みてみた。このような霊術は昔から行者などがよくやる方法であるが、霊的智識の皆無な第三者には判りようがないので、認識させる事は絶対不可能である。しかしともかく霊から聞いてみると、スラスラと私の口から出てくるので、数字などもハッキリしたようだ。むしろ詳しすぎたくらいである。 刑務所行き その翌日例のごとく調べ室に呼ばれた。私は交霊術などと言っても、警察官などに判るはずはないから、色々考えた末こう言った。「実は昨夜絶体絶命の結果一心に神に祈った、すると御利益があって記憶がハッキリ浮び出し、判ったからお答えをする」と言ってスラスラ述べたのである。Ｋ氏もＭ氏も狐に撮（つま）まれたような顔をしていたが、ともかく私の陳述がいつもと違い淀みなく出るのでたちまち調書が出来上った。私は何が何でも訊問の苦しみから免れさえすればいい、ここを出さえすればいいと思い、鰐の口から逃れたような気がしてホッとしたのである。あたかもよしその晩Ｋ検事が出張して来て、いつものように取調べが初まった。私は警察官に述べたと同じようにスラスラと陳述したのでＫ検事は言った。「君は今まで辻棲の合わない事ばかり言っていたのに、急にハッキリしたのは可笑しいじゃないか」と色々訊かれた。なるほど私が今まで述べた運動費の額は五、六十万円と言ったり百万円くらいと言ったり、二百万円以上と言ったり全く出鱈目であったからで、これによってみても全然知らなかった事が判るであろう。それで私は到底理解させる事は困難だと思ったから、神に祈って奇蹟が現れたと答えたのである。これで取調べも一段落となったらしいので私も一安心し、ともかく頭脳の破壊だけは免れ得たと久し振りでその夜は熟睡出来たのである。ところが翌日となるや午前十時頃留置室の外からすぐ出なさいと言う声がした。取調べがすんだので今日釈放されるのかと早合点し、やれ嬉しやと思ったところ、扉が開いて外へ出ると見馴れない警官が立っている。変だなと思うと彼は「これから静岡へ行くんだから仕度をしなさい」と言うので、私は二度吃驚した。留置所係の警官も手伝って毛布を初め身の廻りのもの、持てるだけ持って二人の警官と同行自動車に乗った。約一時間くらいで車が停ったので、みると刑務所の門前ではないか、私はハッとした、マサカ刑務所へ入れられようとは夢にも思わなかったからである。刑務所、刑務所、嗚呼何という恐ろしい忌わしい名ではないか、私は生涯の内刑務所など入れられるような事は絶対ないと信じ切っていた。この時平重盛の有名なアノ言葉を思い出さずにはおられなかった。「昨日は人の身の上と思いしに、今日は我が身に振りかからんとは」その通りだ。一体私は刑務所へ入れられるようなどんな悪い事をしたのであろうか、どうも判らない。疑問がまた一つ増えたと思った。事によると昨夜交霊術によって余りにハッキリ陳述したので、それが法に触れたのではあるまいか、刑務所入りはそのためかとも想像してみたが、そうでなかった事は後で弁護士から聞いて判った。それから型のごとく諸般の手続きを済ませ、警官の案内で、無気味な刑務所の建物の間を通り抜け、一丁程歩くと新しく出来た到底刑務所などとは想えない、モダンな建物の中に連れられ独居の一室に入れられたのである。みると狭いが便所もあり、小さな炊事場もあり、水道も備わっていて、壁は白く窓は大きくて明るく実に気持がよい。真っ暗なジメジメした警察の留置所などとは及びもつかない清潔さで牢獄にいるような気などしない。私は救われた思いである。窓の外を見れば庭型の広場があり、囚人の作ったらしい紫陽花の花さえ咲きかけている。高い厳しい煉瓦（れんが）塀に囲われはしているが、塀上の青空をくっきり描いている新緑滴る五、六本の大きな樹木さえ見えるではないか、間もなく官給の昼飯が来たのでみると驚いた。昔からよく言う物相飯（もっそうめし）とはこれなんだ。麦七分米三分くらいで大きなニュームの椀に盛られている。菜と言えば小さな梅干がタッタ二個きりだ。まず飯を口へ入れてみると、勿体ないが喉へ通りそうもない。すると囚人である弁当配布係が来て「差入がありますから官給弁当はお止しなさい」と言うので止めたが、この時の差入弁当の美味さは、今なお忘れられない味だった。ここへ来て全く別世界へ来たような感がした。 ところが私は前夜Ｋ検事に答えた霊憑り陳述が気になり初めた。というのは元来交霊術というのは生霊を呼んで聞くのだから正確とは言えない。自己意識が混じったり、狐霊の悪戯などもあったりして随分誤りもあるので十数年前止めたくらいである。いわんや昨夜のそれは苦し紛れの産物であるから、どうも自信がもてない。もしか間違った点があるとしたら大変だから、その訳を言って取消して貰わなければならないと囚人係の部長にＫ検事に面会を求めたのが刑務所へ入った翌朝であった。その返事には午後面会するというので待っていたがその日は駄目で、その翌日も頼んだがやはり駄目だった。その日Ｍ弁護士が面会に来たので右の話をして相談してみたところ、弁護士はやはりその事を思った通り言った方がよいと言うのである。私は弁護士に対（むか）っても、霊憑り陳述であるから正確とは言えない。苦し紛れの作り事でいわば推理小説のようなものだと言った。ところがその翌六月十八日刑務所へ来てから四日目であった。夜になってやっと調べ室へ呼び出されたが、ここへ来てから初めての取調べである。ところがこの時一生忘れる事の出来ない一大ショックに出遭った。まず調べ室に入りＫ検事に対い合って椅子にかけるや、イキナリＫ検事は立ち上がり、顔面蒼白、眼はすわり震えながら私に対って大喝一声「君くらい怪しからん人間はない。この間の最後の取調べは推理小説だと言うのか。（ハハア弁護士から聞いたなと思った）僕は真面目に調書を作ったんだよ、君の記憶がハッキリしたので立派な陳述が出来たと思って書いたんだ、それに何ぞや推理小説などとは、検事を侮辱するにも程がある、僕は赦す事は出来ない」と眼光鋭く睨みつけ、噛みつかんばかりの気勢である。私は青天の霹靂どころではない。百雷の一時に落ちたごとくに縮み上がって声さえ出ない。こんなに感情を害してしまった以上、法律知識のない私はどんなことになるか判らないという恐怖で、身体は石のごとく、自己存在の意識すらない。ただ平蜘蛛のようにヘタバッテ一心に謝罪するばかりだ。洵（まこと）に申訳ありません、何卒お許し下さい。私は馬鹿でしたというような言葉を何編も繰り返しつつ、滂沱（ぼうだ）として流るる涙をどうする事も出来なかった、その時検事はこういう事も言った。「君の教団を潰そうと思えば余計な手数は要らない、僕一人の力で一日で潰してしまえるんだよ」。この言葉を聞いて私は愕然とした。私はこう思った。信教の自由を保証されている今日、仮にも三十万の信徒を擁する宗教が、一人の検事の力で一日で潰されるとしたら、宗教なるものの何たる脆弱さであろう。新宗教のナンバーワンなどと言われていい気になっておさまっていた自分は、実は噴火山上で昼寝していたようなものだ。これは大いに考えなくてはならない重大事だと思った。この事も私が救世教教主を退めた動機の一つでもあった。加えるに前述のごとく頭脳が大いに痛められ、今後教主の責任をつくす事は困難と思ったからでもある。私が涙を流しての平あやまりに流石の検事も幾分平静を取戻したらしく、普通の取調べになったようだが、それでもいつもと違い、皮肉タップリでともすれば絡んでくる。ハラハラしながらどうやら答えたが、確かこの時は調書も出来ずに終ったような気がする。この時の調べが済んだ直後、私はこういう事を思った。恐らく私が物心ついて五十有余年、この時程一箇の人間に対し、平身低頭最大級の謝罪の言葉を絞り出し、あやまった事は、いまだかつてなかった。また私は何十年来、涙など流した事もなかったが、この時ばかりは止めどもなく涙が溢れてしようがなかった。一体俺はどんな悪い事をしたんだろう、どうしても判らない。ただ経済面の事は、部下に委せてあったため、私の知らなかった事を、知らなかったと言ったまでで、結局部下の罪を私は被せられたのだ。世間社長の罪を社員が被る事は聞いていたが、社員の罪を社長が、被せられる事は聞いた事がない。しかし部下としても、教団のためと思ってやった事で、悪意からでないには違いないが、と言って部下の過ちは、首脳者が責任を負うという理屈はないばかりか、私の場合は世間一般の人達とは大いに違う。私は宗教家であり、一宗の教祖である。私は神の代行者と信じている。従って神の意志を伝え教えを説くのが私の本領である。この意味において私は俗事の外に超然としているべきであると思っている。従って経済面特に金銭等に関してはただ聞くだけですぐ忘れてしまう。私はそれでよいと思っている。これはひとり私ばかりではあるまい。昔から今に到るまでいかなる宗教の開祖教祖といえども、恐らく金銭上の事にまで関心をもつ者は一人もあるまい。むしろ俗事に離れれば離れる程、真の宗教家の在り方である事は、社会の通有観念である。検察官といえどもそれを知らないはずはあるまい。私はこう考えてくるといよいよ判らなくなる。御承知のごとく新憲法においても信教の自由を認めている。というのは国策上信仰の尊き使命を認識しているからであろう。また飜（ひるがえ）って観る時、昔から一宗の開祖教祖が法難に遭った例は数多くあるが、経済問題で法難に遭った者は恐らくないであろう。 前述のごとくであるから、私といえども宗教以外の容疑に対しては、満足な答弁が出来るはずがないではないか、しかも頭脳の拷問に等しき峻烈な取調べのため、二回まで卒倒したにみて、この恐るべき取調べを避けなければ、頭脳の破壊は免れないと思い、やむなく窮余の一策として神憑的手段に出て、ともかく安全を得たのであるから、私のした事は頭脳擁護のためで、一点の疚しいところはない訳である。とは言うものの、仮にも本当らしく虚言を述べたので、早速訂正したいと思い、弁護士を通じて私の意志を伝えたのである。 以上のごとき経路をよく考えてみると、私のどこに間違った点があるのであろうか、こんなにまで怒られ、怒鳴られ、侮辱を浴びせられ涙まで流して陳謝しなければならないという理由は、何としても発見出来ないのである。今日人権と言う言葉があるが、そんなものはどこにあるのか、これが民主日本であり、文化国家の役人であるとは、どうしても受けとれない。公務員は人民の公僕などと言われるが飛んでもない話だ。ここでは人民は公務員の奴隷でしかないと、私は慨嘆せずにはおれなかったのである。 翌十九日午後再び呼び出され、いつもの通り取調べが始まったが、これはまた意外である。昨夜とは打って変った穏やかさで、私は狐に撮（つま）まれたような気がした。さては今日逮捕されたと聞いた浅井氏から私が贈賄問題とは、何ら関係のない事を、証言したためではなかろうかと想像してもみた。そんな具合でこの時は無理な訊問はなく、言わば派生的なものばかりであったから、スラスラ陳述する事が出来たのである。検事は急用が出来たので「後は晩にしよう」といって室外へ出て行った。その夜九時頃再び呼ばれ、若干の残りの事項を訊かれたが、これも簡単に済んで、調書は大体出来上ったようである。するとイキナリ検事は「君はもう帰ってもいいよ」と言う。私は余りの意外に急には呑み込めず、しばらくまごついたがようやく釈放された事を意識し、十一時頃出所したのである。 カマを掛ける 取調べの場合、カマを掛けるという言葉は昔からよく言われるが、今度の取調べに際しこのカマを掛けられた事実は非常に多く、ほとんど取調べの骨子となっていたと言ってもいい。近来の取調べ方針は誘導訊問を最も嫌っているようだが、しかし誘導訊問よりカマ掛け訊問の方がどのくらい悪質であるか分らない。何となれば誘導訊問の方が取調べの場合嘘が少ないからである。誘導訊問は言葉の技巧であるに比し、カマ掛け訊問の方はほとんど捏造的虚言であって、嘘を本当らしい巧妙な言い廻しで引っ掛けようとする。ゆえに正直な人や経験のない者はうっかり乗ってしまうので、彼らは大いにこの手を用いるのである。もし引っ掛からないとすれば、その人は百も承知の経験者である。経験者とは前科者という訳だから、初犯者は引っ掛り、前科者は巧く逃げるという結果になるから、善人は罪人となり、悪人は無罪となるという訳だ。その何よりの証拠は今回の事件で吾々全部が、このカマ掛け訊問に引っ掛ったのが原因で起訴にまでなったのをみて明らかである。まずその一例をかいてみよう。 今度帰宅後容疑者の一人である私の秘書井上福夫から聞いた話であるが、彼は平素私の仕事に忠実で、二十年間も奉仕していたのだから、彼の性格も行状も判りすぎるくらい判っている。絶対悪人ではない。多くの人の批評によるも「世にも珍しい善人だ。仏様のようだ」と常に言われている。たまには私が叱責する事もあるが、そういう時いつも私は彼に対（むか）って「君は人が善すぎるから困る」というくらいである。彼は実に柔順で人の言いなり放題になり、怒ったり、逆らったり、反対するなどは出来ない性格である。そういう彼が今度カマ掛け訊問に掛ったんだから堪らない。それにはお誂え向きの人間である。彼は記憶にない事はないと何程言ってもテンデ調官は相手にせず、毎日毎日攻められるので、極度の神経衰弱となり、果ては全身的健康さえ損なわれ、この分では生命も危ぶまれそうな心配が湧いて来たので、これは大変と思い、一日も早くここを出して貰わなければならないと何でも言いなり放題に是認したそうである。そんな訳で毎回の答弁は支離滅裂で、調官も非常に困ったそうである。井上のごとき善人を調べるのは、赤児の手を捻じるようなもので、全く善人程可哀相なのはないと思った。 こういう事もあった。私が取調べを受けた際、調官はよく言う事に「今度の事件は僕の方では半年も前から充分調べ抜いたのであるから、今更隠したって何にもならないよ。何でも晒け出して言ってしまった方が君の得だよ」と言うのであるが、取調べ事項を聞いてみる毎に、余りの見当違いに驚いたのである。というのは、ほとんど調べが出来ていないような事項が、余りに多くあったからである。何よりも武装警官八十人も動員したというにみて、いかに調査が届いていなかったかが判るので、もし充分調べがついていたら、そんなに大袈裟な事をする必要はなく、簡単な取調べで済んだはずである。その時私はこうも思った。多勢のスパイを使い信者に化けさせて、徹底的に調べたら一番よかった。そうすれば余りに意外な立派な宗教に驚いて調べるどころか、むしろ国家が大いに支援したくなるくらいだと、思わずにはおれないからである。右のごとくであるからなるほど調べるには調べたであろうが、浅い調べ方であったに違いない。ゆえに充分調査したと言う事は、一種のカマ掛け訊問にすぎないのである。 前述のごとくカマ掛け訊問によって、善人が引っ掛り罪人にされるとしたら、容易ならぬ問題と思った。このような取調べ方法が、唯一のものとされている現行検察制度としたら、人民は迷惑するばかりである。公明正大であるべき司法行政圏内に、右のごとき非民主的の暗雲がありとすれば、一日も速かに払拭して、明朗鏡のごとき法の世界たらしめん事を、望んでやまないものである。 帰 宅 後 ここで、帰宅後の事も一通りかかねばならないが、帰宅後某弁護士に面会、色々取調べの模様を話したところ、その弁護士が言うには「それは惜しい事をしましたね。被告には黙秘権があるんだから、記憶にない事は答弁しなくてもよかったので、黙っていてもそのために不利益を受けないことは、法律上定まっているんですよ。従って今度の貴方の場合お話のように、苦しむ必要はなかったので、知らない事は知らないと主張すればよかったのですよ。作り事を言ったため反って法に引掛ったのだから実に残念でしたね」と言われ、私も吃驚したが、よく考えてみるとそういう法律など知らなかったためで、今更悔んだとてどうにもならないのである。実に今日の社会生活上法律に無知なるため、思わざる災害を被る人も世間には、すくなからずあるであろうから、たとえ宗教人といえども、一通りの法律は心得ておかなければならないと、思わざるを得なかったのである。ところがそれだけではない。今度の私の場合などは、頭脳破壊の一歩手前まで責められ、今もって脳神経衰弱は治らず、極度の眩暈に苦しんでおり、忘れてしまった事も多いので困っている。外出も思うように出来ず、自動車へ長く乗る事も、出来ない有様である。私は短歌を作るのが好きだが、作歌は相当考えなくては、ならないので、これもまだ駄目である。この原稿もやっとの思いでかき上げたが、これは考える必要がなく、最近の経験を有りのまま書くだけだから、左程困難ではなかったからである。 出所後、十数日経って、今一度取調べたいと、Ｋ検事から弁護士を通じて申し来ったので、私はまだ病気が全快しない理由で、二人の医師の診断書を添え、自宅訊問を懇願したが許されなかったので、先方のいう通り当時在住の箱根強羅から直接三島所在の検察署〔庁〕へ赴くのはまだ無理なので、一旦熱海の自宅へ行き一泊したるところ、その翌日検事も同情されたと見え、熱海市所在の検察庁支所まで出張されたから私も近いため出向いたのである。その時の訊問は警察及び刑務所で、度々取調べられた事項の繰返しである。検事は今まで申立てた事は、間違いないか――と訊くので、私はもうこの機会に真実の事を言ってもいいと思ったから、それを言いかけると、Ｋ検事は非常に立腹し「今更前言を覆されては困る。もし君がタッテそうしようとするなら、新規蒔直しに、最初から取調べるがどうだ――」と言われたので、私は吃驚した。何しろ健康も碌々（ろくろく）恢復していないのにまたまた厳しい記憶訊問をされたら大変だ。せっかく治りかけた頭脳を再壊される危険がないとは言えないと思ったので、止むなく検事の希望通り答弁してしまった。それで検事の御気嫌もよく事なく済んだが、帰宅後その通り弁護士に話したところ「それは惜しい事をしましたね――今日のは最後の駄目押しなんだから、今までの間違った陳述を訂正するには、最もよい機会だったんですよ。真実一点張りで頑張れば不起訴になったかも知れない」と言われ、私も取返しのつかない事をしてしまったと悔んだのである。元来、私は人の言う事に反対する事の出来ない性分で、いつも人の言う事をきいてしまうという人並はずれた気の弱さがあり、自分自身に腹を立てる事さえしばしばあるのである。またその時弁護士は検事の様子はどうでしたかと訊くから、「私は初めは変だったが、最後は大分御気嫌が直ったようですよ」と言うと、彼は「それはそうでしょう。御注文通り起訴の理由が出来たからですよ」と言われた。これについて以前私は武者小路実篤氏の小説にあった警句を思い出した。それは「彼は神のごとく弱く、神のごとく強し」という言葉で、非常に面白いと感銘した。ちょうどこの言葉は今の私によく当はまる。すなわち彼という字を、岡田に置き換えればその通りだ。全くこの時の私は神のごとく弱しであったが、しかし私には神のごとく強しと言う一面もある。それは不正を憎み、悪と闘い勝たねば措かぬと言う強さである。 帰宅後、判った事であるが、本教の大幹部渋井総三郎氏が私が出所の日、入替りに勾留されたというので驚いた。種々聞くところによれば、刑務所内から数丁離れた検察局へ取調べのため、数回通わせられた事があったが、その際人通り繁き往来を、編笠を被り、手錠をはめられたまま連行されたというのであるから、いかに厳重な扱いを受けたかが解るのである。そうして同氏は六十余歳の老齢であり、しかも一昨年三回目の脳溢血で倒れたので、医学上から言っても脳溢血は二回目でさえ、生命の危険があるのに、三回目となっては、万に一つも助からないと言うのが定説である。ところが三回目の脳溢血が発った時、私の浄霊によって、ともかく生命は取止め、現在相当よくなってはいるが、いまだ真の全快までには、到っていないので、すべての任務は代行者に委せているくらいで、頭脳を使うのはまだ無理であり、検察官の取調べのごときは不可能である。しかるにそのような実状を知ってか、知らないでか前述のごとく、重罪犯人扱いをするのであるから解し難いのである。本人としても逃走の憂いなく、抵抗の危険等も絶対あり得ない事は常識で考えても判るのみならず、氏は教団の最高幹部として多くの信徒から尊敬されており、しかも氏の頭脳は前述の通りである。とすれば、十数日間刑務所に勾留し、毎日のごとく訊問を続けたという事は、どう考えても無理どころか、むしろ残酷とさえ思えるのである。無論調書なども正確なるものは、出来ようはずはない。そのような半病人が、右のごとき扱いを受けたのであるから、気の毒というより外はない。私が出所の日「渋井はまだ頭がボンヤリしているねえ」と検事は言ったくらいだから、検事も知っている訳である。渋井氏出所後の話によれば、いくら訊問を受けても、全然忘れている事が多いので「自分は頭がボンヤリしていてよく判らないから、そちらでよろしいように書いてくれろ」と言ったら、調官は大喝「この馬鹿野郎」と言ったそうである。一体これでよいのであろうか。私にはサッパリ判らない。 私は、これらに対していささかも批判を加えようとは思わない。ただ聞いたまま、あるがままを記録としてかいたので、批判は読む人に委せるのみだ。ただ私の問いたい事は、なぜにこのように常識では考えられない程な、無慈悲極まるやり方をするかという事である。そうして今度の事件について多くの人の見解が一致してる点は、大袈裟な家宅捜索をしたにかかわらず、骨折損の草疲〔臥〕儲けに終ったので、面目上何らか相当な罪人を出さなければならない羽目になったので、大いに焦り、取調べに無理が出来たのではないかというのである。今一つこういう事を言う人もあった。それは「救世教くらい世間に知れわたった宗教を槍玉にあげ、巧く成功するとしたら、大いに手柄になり、出世の糸口ともなるから一生懸命罪を掘出そうとして、必要以上の苛酷なやり方をしたんですよ。しかしこれはひとり救世教のみではなく、今までにも、こういう事はよくあった例ですよ」との事であったが、私は右のいずれも「そんな馬鹿な事があるはずはない ――と否定してしまった事もあった。その他今回の取調べ方を仔細に検討してみる時、余りに諒解に苦しむ点が多すぎるのである。まず第一不必要と思う程微に入り細にわたって訊問する。例えば誰それにやった金は、誰に命じて、誰の手から、何円札の束で渡したかとか、その日の何時頃どの部屋で渡したかとか、何んと言って渡したとか、その部屋には誰がいたかいなかったかと言うような事まで、繰返し繰返しほとんど同一の事を毎日のように訊くのである。なるほど記憶を呼び起すためにはそういうやり方も多少の効果はないではなかろうが、普通人としてそのような細かい事を二年も三年も経ってから訊かれてもハッキリ記憶している人は、恐らくないであろう。また事件の性質が刑事傷害等に関するものなればともかく、それ程の悪質のものでない事は、検察官なら充分判るはずである。私の経験によれば、特高時代三日くらいで調べ終るような事柄が、今日の調べ方では三十日掛ってもむずかしいであろう。これがため取調べ能率の低下は非常なもので、これらも改善の余地が大いにあると思うのである。 今一つ言いたい事は、今日の検察官が宗教について、余りに理解のない事である。この無理解は何よりも宗教人に対し、いささかの尊敬心もなく、一般人と同様に扱う事で、徳川時代でさえ僧侶は普通人より尊敬されていたそうである。私は警察官からこういう事を言われた。「君は家にいれば神様扱いをされ、みんなが頭を下げ、大切にするか知れないが、ここへ来ちゃ駄目だよ、ここじゃ君だって――スリや泥棒と同じ人間として扱うんだからなあ――その積りで居給え、それが公平なんだから仕方がないよ」との暴言には、私は唖然としたのである。 今一つ言いたい事は、今日の米国の繁栄である。その原因が那辺（なへん）にあるかを、充分検討すべき必要があろう。言うまでもなく同国の一般国民思想はキリスト教が根幹をなしており、それがあらゆる面に表われている。先日彼のマ元帥が、朝鮮問題に対して発表された宣言中にあった「神は吾らの目的を助けるであろう」との一言は、同元帥の信仰がいかに深いかを物語っている。またト大統領初め米国の有識階級はほとんどキリスト教信者という事で、米国の家庭には聖書のない家はほとんど一軒もないとの事であるにみても、同国の民主主義は全くキリスト教精神の現れでなくて何であろう。ところが現在の日本はどうであろうか、今度つくづく思われた事は、検察官の無信仰振りである。それかあらぬか余りに冷酷で、慈悲や情などなさすぎるように思われるのは、私ばかりではあるまい。今回の取調べの際も信仰について語りたいと思っても、全然興味をもっていないので、私は信仰談を中途でやめた事もあった。もちろん検察官本来の目的は罪人を作るに非ず、罪人を無くするにある事は言うまでもないが、事実はその逆でさえあると思えるのである。私は今回の事件で、大いに感じた事はどうしても罪人を扱う者は、宗教観念が根本になくては改過遷善（かいかせんぜん）の実は挙げ得ないと思った。 そうして、吾々宗教人を遇する場合、彼らは普通人同様というよりも、むしろそれ以下にみているとしか思えない程である。察するに彼らの心情は宗教などとは無用の長物と思っているらしい。中には憎悪の念さえ抱いているかのように見える者さえある。こういう事があった。私の部下の一人が、今度の事件で引っ張られ、数人の合部屋へ三十余日拘禁されたが、入獄中毎日毎日苛酷な取調べを合部屋の者に話したところ、前科何犯という強盗、傷害の囚人が驚いて言うには「俺達でもそんなヒドイ取調べを続けられた事はいまだかつてなかった、そういうヒドイ取調べは一日か二日だけで、後は普通だ」と言っていたそうである。これらによってみても、宗教人はいかに軽蔑されているかが判るのである。しかし当局者のみを咎（とが）めるのは当らないかも知れない。何となれば宗教を看板にして随分詐偽やインチキを行う輩も、世間すくなからずあるからである。従って今回の事件に鑑（かんが）み、吾々といえども大いに世の信頼をかち得べく自省しなければならない事を痛感したのはもちろんである。この意味において、神は吾らの覚醒を促すべく、今回のごとき尊き試練を与え給うたとも解されるのである。 （「法難手記」より引用） 白 書 徳川夢声 ありのままを記す。 私はメシヤ教の信者ではない。 が、頭から迷信邪教として、全面的に否定するものでもない。 世間には、どうもモノゴトを、右か左か、善か悪か、正か邪か、なんでもハッキリきめないと承知出来ない人が多い。それも、自分で判別して、そうきめるなら、まだしも結構だが、中には、人の云ったことで、そのままそう定めこんでる人がある。こんなのこそ、迷信家と同病の運命であろう。 然し、現実としては、モノゴトはそうハッキリ二通りに分けられるものでない。右と左の中間が、無数にある。更に、これが立体的に、前後あり上下あり、またその中間があり、実に複雑極まる。善悪、正邪、美醜、やっぱりその通りだ。 私が、正直にありのままを記すとしても、これを読んで、 Ａ 夢声はメシヤ教信者なり Ｂ 夢声はメシヤ教不信者なり Ｃ 夢声は邪教を信ずるものなり Ｄ 夢声は正教を疑うものなり Ｅ 夢声は真相を伝うるものなり Ｆ 夢声は歪文曲筆せるものなり Ｇ 夢声は買収されて書きたり Ｈ 夢声は良心に従って書きたり という風に、いろいろと判定されるであろう。判定なさる方は各々、至極アッサリと判定なさるが、判定される方は、右のように複雑なる結果を受けるわけだ。 でもとにかく一応、私の書いたところを読んでから、判定を下すのは、それがどんな判定でも、やむを得ないが、てんで読みもしないで、上下の話など用いて、頭から迷信的に私を判定されるのに一番困る。 まず、私とメシヤ教の関係を記す。 昨年の夏、箱根でメシヤ教のお祭りがあり、某興行会社がその余興番組を引き受け、私にも出演を依頼して来た。 その時、体の都合がつかなかったので、私はお断りした。少し無理をすれば、一日ぐらい、なんとかなったのだが、実を云うと私は、 ――インチキ宗教の祭典なんか御免だ。 という心もちがあったのである。勿論、まず、メシヤ教なんて名前も知らず、ただオヒカリ様とか、オヒカリ教とかで心得ていた。 ――オヒカリ様なんて、大した詐欺師に違いない。 そんな風にも思っていた。 ところが、その祭典に、私たちの芸能人団体の一員である、Ａ君が出演した。Ａ君はメシヤ教信者に、青年層が沢山居るのを奇妙に思った。オヒカり様なんか、有難がるのは老人連ばかりと、思っていたらしい。しかもその青年層には、見たところインテリが多い。 ――はて、これはどうしたわけだろう？ どちらかというと、無神論者であり、従って宗教などには関心なく、況んや邪教の類は人一倍オカシがっていたＡ君であったが、その後、数回出演のため出かける度に、少しずつ惹きつけられて行った。 そして実に自分自身も入信して、例のメシヤ教独得のオマモリを受けるに到ったのである。もっとも、入信したと云っても、Ａ君としては、百パーセント信仰しての上ではなく、幾分は好奇心も手伝い、幾分は稼業意識も動いていたのだろう。教団は、Ａ君にとっては好いお得意様でもあったわけ。 さて、Ａ君が講習を受け、オマモリを授けられて、帰宅してみると、彼の愛児がジフテリアで、二本目の血清注射を、これから受けようというところだった。 Ａ君は、早速、講習を受けたばかりの方法で、御浄霊を試みた。が、実は、あんまり自信はなかった。こんなことで、病気が治るのだろうか、そう疑いながら、愛児の患部に、手をかざしてると、咽喉のゼーゼーいう音が、少しずつ静まって行くようである。 ――おや、俺がやっても効くらしいぞ！ と、益々勢を得て、なおも御浄霊もやり続けた。苦しんでいた愛児は、眠りに落ち、咽喉の喘鳴も全く聞えなくなった。 そして、翌日はもう元気よく、遊び廻るようになったと云う。これでＡ君はすっかり自信がついたのである。 その後、家族の者や、近所の人々やに、試みて見るに、百発百中、いずれも見事に奏効して、果てはあちらからも、こちらからも依頼されるので、肝腎の稼業の方が妨げられるようなことになった。 このＡ君から、是非と頼まれて、私は今年（昭和二十六年）の春の祭典に、物語を一席演るべく熱海に出かけた。それは、別にメシヤ教を有難がって出かけたわけでなく、Ａ君は私の準門弟みたいな人であるし、その頼みをムゲには断れない。それから、芸能人として稼業のため出入するのは、これも当り前の話。 もう一ツ、大きな理由があった。それは、丁度そのころ、週刊朝日の「問答有用」という連載対談を始めていたので、教祖岡田氏との対談が欲しかったのである。編集部も大乗り気で、是非ともそういう段取に願いたいと云う。それにはどうしても、一応先方様の仰せに従っておいて、それからこちらの頼みを持ち出す必要がある。 で、私は三月二十一日、熱海に行き、祭典の大広間で、宮本武蔵を一席喋った。明主岡田氏は最前列で聞いていた。その後で、私は岡田明主夫妻と、別室で語り合った。 「ひと目見た時に、これはクセ者だなと思づた」 と、明主は私を評した。 「クセ者は驚いたなア、然し、そんなことを云えば、あなたこそクセ者ですな」 と、私が云った。一座、爆笑である。 この時私は、対談のことを申し入れ、快諾を得て、四月十二日、速記者と写真班と、それから横山泰三君をつれて、熱海の碧雲荘に出かけ、面白い記事をとることが出来たのであった。 明主の語るところ、私は全面的に信ずるわけには行かなかった。どうも、私の常識から判断して、うなづけない点も相当ある。が、大いにまた共鳴する点もある。殊に、病気というものに対する一家言は傾聴に値するところ多々ある。 談たまたま美術に及んで、宗達筆の竜虎の双幅を見せてもらったり、梅原竜三郎筆の力作二面を見せてもらったりして、その美術論を聞くに及び、 ――これは、少くとも従来の教祖たちとは、大分趣きの変った人種である。 と、見直したのであった。（この夜、辞するにあたり、小林一茶筆の茶掛けを贈られたのは、非常に嬉しかった） 病気というのには、大抵は、放っとけば治るものも、いろいろ間違った手当をしたり、無理な薬を用いたりするから、反って悪くして了う。多くの場合、たしかにその通りだと私も信ずる。私が信ずるだけでなく、多くの名医たちがそう信じて、そう云ってる。 ここまでは問題はない。 どんな病気でも、クスリは絶対に用いない方がよろしい。医者の必要は全然ない。 さあ、こうなると話は難かしくなる。時と場合によっては、クスリも好かろうし、医者も必要だろう、と現在の私は考えてる。 だから、風邪ぐらいでは、切論医者にかからない。ちょっと胃が痛い、頭が痛いぐらいは放っておく。けれども、ひどく血便が出たり、多量に血を吐いたりすると、私は医者にかかるのである。 ところで、メシヤ教の機関紙を読むと、毎号、沢山の所謂オカゲ話が載せてある。それらの記事を読んでると、如何なる病気も、御浄霊で治癒しないのは無いみたいだ。 勿論、これらの話はウソでないのだろう。ウソ話を麗々しく載せたようなら、メシヤ教はインチキである。が、考えてみると、これは治癒した場合だけの報告集であるかもしれない。恐らくそうであろうし、またそれが当然のことでもある。 問題とすべきは、御浄霊によつて、治癒した場合と、治癒しなかった場合との比率が、どうであるかということだ。 あらゆる点が完備した病院でも、治癒する場合と、治癒しない場合がある。だから御浄霊で治癒しない病人があったって一向に不思議はない。御浄霊でよくならなかった病人があるからと云うので、御浄霊そのものを否定するのは粗忽である。 然らば、その御浄霊なるものが、本当に病気を治す力ありやなしや、ということが重大な点であろう。 人間の掌から、或る種の放射線が出ることは、今日既に科学的に測定されている。私自身が、それを測定したわけではない。が、科学者の報告を信じて、私はそう云う。 御浄霊の際、施術者の掌から、或る種の放射能が出て、それが患部に作用するなり、身体全部の生活力を旺盛にするなりして、病気を治療するということは、これは少くともアリ得ルことである。 ――絶対にそんなことはアリ得ナイさ。 と云う人があれば、その人は甚だ非科学的で、確信的であると云える。そんなら、アリ得ナイということを科学的に証明してもらいたい。 もっとも、現在、渕定機によって計られる放射線が、病気を治す放射線かどうかは、まだ分らない。病気を治す放射線は、別のものであって、それはまだ現在の測定機には、現われてこないものかもしれない。 そこで、この問題は、御浄霊なるものによって、病気がどうなったか、或いはどうにもならなかったか、それらの実例を出来るだけ沢山に調査して、帰納的に結論をつける、――これが最も穏当な方法だろう。 とは云うものの、私自身には、その調査をしている時間もなければ、用意もない。よろしくメシヤ教の信者なり、撲滅論者なりが、そうした研究をなすべきだと思う。 御参考のため私の周囲から、Ａ君の実例を少しくあげて見ることにする。 私の妻が、肩がこって困っていた。Ａ君が簡単に、手をヒラヒラさせて御浄霊をすると翌日コリがすつかり除れていた。一回きりでは根治というわけには行かない。またコルのである。 また一回やってもらう。また治るのである。 最近私は、吐血したり、タール便が出たりしたので、入院したが、Ｂ君が五回ばかり来てれて、浄霊をしてれた。Ｂ君は、元、新東宝の助監督であって、ふとした機縁で入信し、ついに映画の仕事を止めて了って、今では専門に浄霊業をやってるんだ。こちらから頼んだわけでなくＢ君の方から好意で病院にやって来たのである。病気は案外に軽く、予定よりもズッと早く退院したが、これは御浄霊のお蔭かどうか分らない。 然し、Ｂ君の話を聞くと、奇蹟的に大病の治った例が、実に沢山あるのである。Ｂ君は映して、ツクリ話を私に聞かせるような人でない。信用の出来る人格の人だ。 退院後は、Ａ君が毎日のようにやって来て、私の患部に浄霊してくれた。私はグングン快方に向った。然し、これは浄霊のためかどうか分らない。一向、効かなかったのかもしれないし、大いに効いて、それがため忽ち元気になれたのかもしれない。 私の家に、元海軍の兵曹だったＣ君が、遊びに来る。Ｃ君は、背中にブツブツと掻ゆいものが出来て困っていた。Ａ君が或る夜、浄霊のヒラヒラをやったら、ただ一回でそれきり掻ゆくなくなった。 私の家に一匹の猫が居る。何が原因か分らないが、片方の眼が腫れて、まるで四谷怪談のお岩さまみたいになった。Ａ君が一回、浄霊をすると、翌日、眼の下にクチがあいて、夥だしい膿が流れ出し、忽ち、腫れが退いて了った。腫れは退いたが、眼のふちは相変らす赤く爛れて、ひどく眼ヤニが出る。その後、また一回ヒラヒラやってもらったが、眼ヤニの方は相変らす酷い。引き続いてやったわけでないから、治らなくても不思議はない。が最初の唯一回で、一遍に膿が出た時は、家内中アッと驚いた。 私の家の近所に運送店がある。そこの赤ン坊が小児喘息で困っていた。病院に通って、クスリを四通りももらって治療するんだが、どうも思わしくない。そこで試みにＡ君を見舞わせて見た。一週間ほど見舞ったら、すっかり快方に向った。 Ａ君の施術が、最も奇蹟的に現われたのは、或る漫才師に於てである。この男は結核で寝こんでいた。漫才というものは一人では出来ない。そこで寝ている当人も大弱りだが、相棒の漫才君はピンピン健康なだけに、なお更閉口していた。 仙台放迭局が、開局二十五週年だったかの記念番組で、この漫才に出演方を申込んで来た。コンビが寝こんでいるので、それを引き受けるわけに行かない。 Ａ君が同情して、病気はなんとかなるだろうから、とにかく仙台を引き受け給え、僕が御浄霊してあげよう、と云った。 「え？ 引きうけても大丈夫ですか？ もう日はいくらもありよせんぞ。もしも、これで仙台に行けたら、それこそ奇蹟ですわ」 とピンピン氏の方が云った。 なんと、仙台にはちゃんと間に合ったのである。私も、二人の放送を聞いたが、立流なものであった。 仙台の放送が間に合ったばかりでなく、その重態氏は、それきり起き上って了い、北海道の旅に出かける元気だ。彼は、まったく蘇生の想い、大いに感激して、Ａ君を通じて入信するに到った。 かくの如く、半信半疑で始めたＡ君が、到る所で、奇蹟の連続である。もっとも、唯一人だけダメなのがあった。それは疫痢であって、その子は助からなかったそうだ。 元映画助監督Ｂ君は、死後三時間ぐらいの屍体に御浄霊をして、破裂せんばかりに膨れ上っていた複部を、小さくしたそうだ。夥だしい排尿があって、縮まったのである。 私は、猫に効いたり、屍体に効いたりするところが、甚だ面白いと思う。つまり、御浄霊というのは、神霊的な作用というより、物理的な作用ではないかと思うのだ。 大人よりも、子供の方が、浄霊の効果顕著であると、Ａ君もそう云ってる。子供の方が、暗示にかかり易いとも考えられるが、また子供の方が素直に物理現象を感ずるとも考えられる。 いずれにしても、科学が現在より数段の進歩をしたら、浄霊の謎は解かれるのであろう。 信心と奇蹟 戸川貞雄 私は二十余年間、毎月二十一日には、川崎のお大師さまにおまいりをしている。二十余年間、一日も欠かしたことがない。いや、そう言ってはウソになる。長い間には、旅行なぞのために、おまいりの出来なかった場合もあったし、病気で出かけられなかったことも一二度はあったのだから。しかし、そんな場合には、うちの誰かに代参をしてもらった。せめてそうでもして気を休めた。 この毎月二十一日の川崎の大師詣りの話をすると、私の友人は大てい苦笑いしたり、口先きでは感心したようなことを言っても、ハラの底では、バカにしているような連中が多い。私の友人は、商売柄、大たいいわゆるインテリだから。私もインテリの端くれだが、およそインテリほど始末のわるいものはないと、自分でも思っている。爪の垢ほどの知識や教養に毒されて、魂の、生得の、貴重な純真さを失っているのである。 一トころ、辛らつな社会時評や文芸批評で鳴らした故杉山平助などは、もっとも無遠慮な男で、私が川崎詣りの話をすると 「閑人だねえ、この人は。どういうわけで君はそんなに熱心におまいりにゆくのだい？何か、われわれにも首肯出来る理由があるのかい？」 と、質問してきた。 「理由なんかないよ」 私が答えると 「理由もないのにそんなことするのはおよそ無意味だね。まさか、インテリの君が、世間一般の衆愚共と同様、お大師さまを信心してお詣りに出かけるわけでもないだろう。弘法大師は確かにえらい人物にちがいないが、君は弘法大師を尊敬しているのか。尊敬のあまり敬意を表しにゆくのなら、わからんこともないがね」 と、かれは突っ込んできた。 「どうもそう評論家らしく突ツ込んでこられると困るがね。なにも特別に弘法大師その人を尊敬しているからというわけでもないさ。そうかといって、厄除けの願掛けにおまいりするというわけでもないがね」 と私は笑いながら答えた。 「わからんね。おれにはとても納得が出来ん」 と、かれは首を振った。 これは納得が出来んにちがいないと私も内心苦笑した。納得してもらえるような理由は何もないからだ。しいて、理由といえば、私は一ト月に一日だけでも、インテリとして身にしみついている垢を落したいと思うからである。 「つまりね、毎月二十一日にはね、僕は、君のいわゆる衆愚の仲間入りがしたいのさ。愚婦愚夫といってもいい、または、善男善女と呼んでもいいが、ゾロゾロとお大師さまに参詣する連中の一人になってね。病難平癒だの家内安全だの商売繁昌だの、欲の深いお願いに、乏しいお賽銭を投げてさ。名物のクズ餅を食ってね。多少懐中に余裕のある月には、横浜へ廻って支那料理を食づて、映画か何か見て、帰ってくる。その間、バカになって商売の文学のことも、むつかしい人生のことも、何も念頭から拭い去ってね。まァ言わば月に一日の休養日、感謝日さ、だから、大変お大師さまにはすまないことだが、信心でも何でもない。お大師さまも苦笑しておいでだろう」 大たい、私はこんなことを言った。すると相手の杉山平助は 「君は長生きをするよ」 と、吐き出すように言い、これ以上追究してもムダだというように横を向いてしまったものである。 「地上天国」の第七号に、信心の分類が出ているが、私のこの種の信心は、利己的信心にほかならぬから、「お蔭信心」の一種か、でなけれは有難信心に属するたぐいにちがいないので、むろん自慢にはならない。まして、私の家は代々の日蓮宗で、仏壇には、祖師日蓮の尊像がかざってある。日蓮は、他宗嫌いだ。私は、むろん春秋のお彼岸にも、盆暮にも、先祖代々の墓参を欠かしたことはない。これは祖先にたいする子孫の礼で、その限りにおいては、私は、家の宗旨に応分の奉仕と信心を怠りなく続けているわけだが、他宗のお大師さまに、毎月欠かさずおまいりする習慣は、宗旨には関係のない私の気紛れだから、これは「気紛れ信心」の一種とも言われようか。あるいは信心とは言えないかも知れぬ。 しかし、私には、大師詣りをはじめた動機というものがある。ほかでもない、今日はすでにこの世の人ではないが、妻の老母の信心振りに、心を打たれたのが動機である。老母は、四国の人間だから、弘法大師信仰の地元に生れ、お遍路さまの雰囲気に育まれて、八十六歳まで生きた愚婦の一人なのだが、今から二十余年前、すでに七十五、六歳になつていた老いの身で、胃弱の病身で、国元の多度津から、私の在住する神奈川県は平塚市の拙宅まで、孫の顔を見にはるばるやってきた。若い時から、胃がわるいというので、菜食主義を守りとおしてきた人間だったが、見るからに病身そうな、骨と皮ばかりの、小柄な、腰の曲った老婆であった。 私はこの遠来の老婆をねぎらうために、乏しい財布の底をはたいて、東京や横浜の盛り場だの、ビル街だのを案内したものだが、どうもあまりうれしそうでない。食事なぞも、菜食だから、どこへ連れていって御馳走しても、有難迷惑そうなのである。駅の階段の昇降なぞは、ひどく大儀そうなので、私は手を曳いてやった。滞在およそ一週間、こちらでは、出来る限り歓待して上げたつもりであったが、大たい予定のスケジュールも終って、最後は、川崎のお大師さまということになった。それまで、私は家内と一緒にお詣りをしたことはあったが、別にお大師さまを信仰していたわけではなかった。この妻の老母が、便りの度毎に 「先頃そちらに生れた孫はお大師さまの申し子だから大師さまを信心してくれ」 なぞと言ってくるので、実は、苦笑いしながら、川崎大師へ気紛れにおまいりしたことがある程度であった。老母の申し子云々には曰く因縁故事来歴があるのだが、その頃、若い私は笑殺していたものだ。ただあんまり老母が熱心に言ってくるので、その後、中学生になった長男と次男を連れて、夏季旅行に四国へ出かけ、お礼詣りをしたことがある。これは面白い旅行で、今だに伜共と思い出話のタネにしている。 さて、老母を川崎大師に案内したときの話だが、この数日の東京、横浜見物で、たださえ病弱な老いの身の、ヘトヘトになっていたこの老母が、その日はまるで別人の如く、お大師さまの山門をくぐるや、案内の私をあとに、まるで何ものかに憑かれでもした如く、先に立って、足も宙に、ずんずん、ずんずん、本堂へ突き進んでゆく。階段など昇るときの足どりは、うしろから見ていると、ふわふわと、天にでも昇る人の足どりだ。やがて本堂の広間に入り、ひれ伏している老母の小さな後姿を私はうしろから見つめているうちに、その貧しい老婆の姿から、後光がさしているような気がしてきたのである。私は、階段をふわふわ昇ってゆく老婆の足どりを、昇天する人の足どりのようだったと言ったが、全く、そのまゝもう帰ってはこないのではないかという気がしたくらいである。後光がさしていたようだと言ったのも、誇張ではないのである。そしてこの時、私はハッと胸を打たれたのである。信ずることの強さ、美しさ、それは理屈では納得の出来ない事柄である。その翌日、老母はとても元気になって国元へ帰って行った。そして私はこの日以後、老母の心を心として、川崎大師へお詣りにこようと思い立ったのである。一念発起と言っては大袈裟だが、この無知蒙昧な老母によって、私は心に燈を点ぜられたように思う。以来二十余年、私は、今亡き老母の姿を偲びつゝ、理屈なしに、お詣りをつづけてきたわけである。 そんなわけだから、私は何も御利益を望んではいない。厄除けのつもりでおまいりをしているわけでもない。ただ、月一回のおまいりを、大たい欠かすことなしに、のんぴりと生前の煩しさから解放された気持ちで二十余年もつづけてこられたことは、まことに有難い御利益だと感謝している。これ以上の御利益があるだろうか。人生は朝顔の如しだ。朝の紅顔夕の白骨とも言われる。人生五十年のうち、すでに二十六年を無事息災で月に一日の休息日をめぐまれてきた事実は、仇おろそかなこととは思われないのである。 川崎の大師さよも、戦災で全焼した。私の家も平塚で戦災のために全焼した。お大師さまの焼跡に佇み、暗い曇り空を仰いで私は合掌した。拙宅の方がおくれて罹災したのだが、焼跡の鳩小舎のなかに起臥しながら、私は川崎大師の罷災を思い、お互いにえらいめにあいましたなとつぶやいたものだ。私は一向たじろがなかった。厄除けを看板のお大師さまさえ、災難は免れない。 神社だって仏だって、建築物である限りは、戦火にもあい、天変地異に際しては、焼けたり倒れたりすることのあるのに不思議はないのである。ところが、せ間の不信心者は、こんな現象を見ると、 「そら見ろ、日本は神国だなんて言っているが、御伊勢さんだって、宮城だって爆弾をよけることが出来なかったじゃないか。川崎大師なんて、厄除けもアテにならん。神も仏もあるものか。信仰も信心も、愚民の迷信だよ」 なぞと、軽薄な放言をしたがる。 しかし、私に言わせると、こんな放言をすること自体が、すでに迷信に囚われていることの証拠で、こういうことを言う連中に限って、たまたまちょッと奇蹟めいた現象を見せられると吃驚してしまって、盲目的な信者になってしまう。神社仏閣が火事や地震で焼亡したり倒壊したりすることに不思議がないと同じ意味で、釈迦にせよキリストにせよ、弘法大師にせよ日蓮上人にせよ、われわれから見て奇蹟としか考えられないような現象をわれわれに見せてくれることにも何の不思議はないのである。天地自我の運行を、宇宙の真理を、すなおに信ずることの出来る人間にとっては、不思議もなければ奇蹟もないのである。ただ、われわれは知識だの教養だのという、なま半かなもの即ち邪念妄想に妨げられて、すなおに信することが出来ないために、神社仏閣が焼亡すると心がぐらつき、奇蹟を見ると吃驚仰天するだけの話なのである。われわれにはわからないことがたくさんある。そのわからない事柄を、片端から奇蹟にされたんでは、奇蹟も助かるまい。 不幸なことは、物質文明の長足の進歩につれて、反比例的に、精紳科学方面にたいする一般の認識が退化したことである。おかしいのは、わけても全く次元を異にした世界、心霊界の研究をするのに、既得の物質科学の世界における科学的な研究方法に頼っていることで、卑近な例で言えば、心霊現象をキャッチするのに、現在の性能しかないカメラを使ったりしていることだ。次元の異なる、超科学的現象なる心霊界の現象を、なぜ、物質科学の機械的方法でとらえねば納得が出来ないのか。納得させようとするところに致命的な矛盾がある。失敗するのは当然なことだし、マゴマゴすれば、インチキ扱いされる。 心霊現象を、科学的な方法で証拠だてようと考えるなんて、そもそもナンセンスだ。われわれのもっとも単純な五官の働き、感覚にさえ、万人それぞれの度合いでちがいがある。色感、音感、触感、みなちがう。それがさらに精神的な、感情になると、ちがう度合いがいよいよ多くなる。絵画、彫刻、音楽、文学等々にたいする鑑賞能力や感受の度合いなぞ、万人みなちがう。 況んや、未知の世界、次元の異なる心霊界にたいするわれわれの認識の度合いに至っては千人に一人、万人に一人、千万人に一人という工合に、感応、交霊の度合いがちがうのは当然のことである。それを万人にひとしなみに納得させようとするのは無理で、いわゆる縁無き衆生に法を説くの愚か、馬の耳に念仏のたぐいであろう。往々にして、霊現象等を公開したり、念写によって心霊の機能を証明したりする試みが、新聞紙の片隅で取上げられて冷かされているのを見るが、これは冷かされても仕方がないだろう。バカげた試みなのだから。猫に小判、豚に真珠、勿体ない話である。 信ずるものは、証拠がなくても信ずるのである。信ずることが出来るのである。証拠を見せても、信ずることの出来ない、不幸な魂の持主には、インチキか、種仕掛けのある、トリックとしか思えないのだから、お互に無駄な話だと思う。しかも世の中には、この種不幸な魂の持主が多いのだから、いつの世でも、天才者や先覚者は苦労が絶えない。そこでたとえば日蓮上人は、波の上に南無妙法蓮華経を書いたり、竜ノ口で白刃に電撃を加えたりしてみせなければおさまらないことにもなるのであろう。弘法大師の遺した奇蹟のあとは、随所にある。後の世に及んでも、善男善女はこれを信じ、随喜の涙を流しているのである。信ずるものにとっては、奇蹟はもはや奇蹟ではないのである。偶然はもはや偶然ではないのである。理外の理として、因縁因果として、納得がいっているのである。 私の祖母にこんな話がある。 私の姉は、私と同じように、この祖母に大そう可愛がられていたのであるが、私が七歳、姉が十歳のとき、姉は台湾でペストで亡くなった。私もそのとき、両親と共に、台湾にいたのであるが、祖母は老齢ではあるし、東京に残っていたのである。この祖母が厄介になっていた家の人びと、わけてもその家の長女は、一般人とちがって鋭敏な感応の機能の持主であって、いろいろ面白い話があった。先にも述べたとおり、われわれの霊の機能は万人ひとしからず、人によっては奇蹟を示すのであって、それは不思議なことではないのである。 ちょうど、私の姉が台湾で死んだ晩、臨終の息を引取った時刻のこと、この家の離座敷に起居していた祖母は、母屋の方から、長い廊下を伝って、バタバタ、バタバタ、小さな足音が近づいてきたかと思うと、やがて、バタリと自分の部屋の前まできて倒れた音がしたのを、ハッキリ聞いいた。胸さわぎがするので、床に起きなおっているところへ、この家の長女がやってきて、 「お婆さん、いま、子供の足音がしたでしょう」 とたずねた。 「えゝ、そうしてこの部屋の入口まできて、バタッと転んだようで、それッきり聞えなくなってしまいました」 こう、祖母がこたえると、この家の長女はハタと膝を叩いて、 「お婆さん、亡くなったンじゃないでしょうか？ 台湾のお孫さんが、知らせに見えたんですよ、きっと」 と、声をふるわせて言った。 「わたしも今そう思っていたところですがね」 それから祖母は寝巻を着換え、珠数を手にして、朝まで仏壇の前に坐っていた。 ほんとにその時刻に、私の姉は台湾で亡くなったのである。 こんな話は、おそらく珍らしいことではなかろう。お寺さんへでも行けば、耳にタコが出来るほど聞かされるたぐいの話にすぎないであろう。しかも大ていの人は、これを信じたがらない。気のせいだとか、幻視幻聴にすぎぬとか、偶然何かの音なり形なりが、そんな迷いを起させたのだろうとか言って、おかしいくらい、一所懸命になって否定し去ろうとする。これがおかしい。心のどこかには、信じようとする何かがある。その何かを一所懸命におさえつけようと努力しているかのようである。 昼間、明るいところで、多勢人がいるところでは、十人が十人、幽霊の存在を否定して誰も怪しまない。幽霊の存在を認めるのがおかしいくらいに思われる。その十人が十人、その夜、一人になって、真暗い墓地を歩いたとすると、十人が十人とも、昼間の幽霊ばなしを思い出して、恐怖におそわれること請合いである。鬼火がチロチロ青白く燃えている。燐だ。不思議はない。白いものがフラフラ宙に揺れている。白張りの提燈である。これも不思議はない。白いものが、パッと飛び出した。ノラ犬だ。不思議はない。にもかかわらす、もう完全にまいッてしまって、真青になり、ぶるぶるふるえ出す。ふるえる方が、不思議だ。 なぜだろう？ この場合、恐怖心こそ遠く祖先と自分の魂とをつないでいる「きづな」なのである。人間として祖先から代々血で受けついできている本能が、昼間のさまざまな妨げの失われた今、この好適な環境で、きわめて自然にすなおに目ざめて、今は幽明境を異にしている祖先の人々の霊魂の存在に触れるのである。そこでこの目ざめの深い人、鋭い人、感応度の過敏な人、そういう人になると、この場合、ほかの人には見えない幽霊の姿を、ありありと見ることがあり得るのである。 「ゆうべ幽霊を見たよ」 と、この種の人は、その経験を他人に伝えようとする。 「冗談言うな。今どき幽霊なんかあるものか。幽霊の正体見たり枯尾花、こわいこわいで物干竿の浴衣でも見たんだろう」 と、大ていの人びとは、相手にしない。 これが普通である。 自分の経験を他人に知らせたい欲望から、あまりしつこく言うと、狂人扱いされる。それほどではなくても、幻視幻聴、気の迷いにされて、笑いのめされてしまう。しかも十人が十人、万人が万人、深夜の墓地に一人で一時間佇んでいる勇気は持合わせない。さらにこのおかしな恐怖心の何ものであるかを追求しようともしないのである。夜が明けると、けろりとして、すべてをきわめて簡明に科学的に片附けて、幽霊のことなんか忘れ去ってしまう。次元の異なる世界とは没交渉でいられる世界に生きているからである。幽明境を異にした世界でみんな忙しいのである。死ねば、万人ひとしくおもむかねばならぬ世界の消息を、誰もさぐろうとは思わすにいる。坊主にまかせておけ、である。坊さんはお葬式が商売で、あの世のことは何も知ってはいない。坊さんばかりではない。誰も、あの世の消息には通じていないのである、幽霊を除いては。しかも、その幽霊が、あるのか、ないのか、科学的には、今のところ、証明の方法がないのである。 心霊現象に就いても同じことが言えよう。奇蹟はあるのである。ただ、現在までの科学では、証明することが出来ないだけの話である。われわれの経験から得てきた知識なぞというものは、知れたものである。私が、インテリを嫌悪するのは、鼻クソほどの学問知識を鼻にかけたがるからである。私の川崎大師詣りも、自分自身からそうしたインテリ臭を追放すると同時に、いわゆるインテリにたいするあてつけの気味もある。私はこれから上京してお寺詣りにゆくところだ。今日はお盆の十六日で、私のお寺にはお施餓鬼がある。有縁無縁の仏たちに見参せねばならぬ。 ここまで書いてきたところへ、市の税務課から、市民税の徴税令書がきた。そういえば今月は所得税の申告月であった。私は忽ち憂鬱になってしまった。納税は国民の義務であるのに、不心得千万な話だと自分でも恥じ入る。然し正直なところ、十人が十人、徴税令書がくると、憂鬱になるにちがいないと思う。なぜかといえは、お互いに生活が苦しいからだ。つまり貧乏だからである。全く、貧ほど辛いものはない。四百四病のほかにもも一病、貧の病という奴があるとは、古来から言われていることだ。 たまたま世界救世教の「世界救世教教義解説」の病貧争の巻という小冊子を拝見すると、冒頭に、「教祖の御宣言」として、「此の世から、病と貧と争をなくし、病なく貧なく争いなき世界――即ち『地上天国』を建設する」とあり、これは「神の命である」と掲げられてある。 結構である。誰も双手を挙げて歓迎するところにちがいない。先ず以て、私の場合にしたところで、私のような忠実な国民の一人が、国民としての義務の負担に堪えかねて、憂鬱になるというのも、貧乏のせいである。これをなくすことは正しく神の命であるにちがいない。しかもこの神の命を人類は遵奉していない。既成の宗教、仏教でも基督教でも、人類を幸福にするに、貧乏から人類を救済しようと努力してきているけれども、一向にその実は挙っておらぬ。世界救世教は、新興宗教として、如何なる方法で貧をこの世からなくそうとするのであろうか。 この小冊子ではそこまで説いていないが、正しい信者になれば福が授かり、仕事も成功し、お金も儲かる、とでも言うのであろう。実は、もう既成宗教のお説教はたくさんなのである。濁富だとか清貧だとか、富める者の天国に入るは駱駝の何とやらだとか、金持ちより貧乏人の方が幸福だとか、貧乏を苦にするな、清貧を楽しめとか、そんなお説教はたくさんなのである。税が納められないために一家心中をして揃って天国へ行くよりも、現代の人は、死んで地獄へ落ちてもいいから、現世で納税の苦から救って貰いたいと希うであろう。新興宗教はこの切なる希いにこたえてくれるものでなければなるまい。 病をなくすことでも同じわけである。病気はなおして貰わねば困る。実は、科学的にどうのこうのというような理屈は、二の次三の次である。医学も薬も、病気をなおすために存在するので、医薬以外に、よりもっと効果的な療法があれば、それに頼るのが当然なことでもあり人情の自然でもある。救世教が、霊魂とか指圧とかいう療法で、病人を健康人にすることが出来るなら、医者や薬屋に遠慮はいらぬ。大いにやって頂きたい。 そうなると医者や薬屋さんはメシの食い上げになるかも知れぬが、そんな取越苦労は無用だろう。立派な、たとえばお釈迦さんやイエスさまのような教世主が現われて、貧乏や病苦や争いを地上からなくそうと献身なされてから、何千年になっても、、地上からは貧も病も争いもなくなるどころか、益々ふえている。救世教が掲げる理想もその実現は前途遼遠たること疑いはないから、医者も、薬屋も、ついでに政治家も、坊主も、安心して可なりである。既成宗教は、この現世を持てあまして、その救いを天国や極楽の方へ持ち越して、信ずるものは幸いなりとか、縁なき衆生は度し難しとか、うまいことを言って逃げてしまったが、新興宗教たる救世教でも、これと軌を一にするものか否か。 さすがに、しかし、メシヤ教は確かに現代の新宗教になっている。近代科学を無視せず、教祖の説くところという霊主体従説の裏書に、いわゆる知識階級層にも納得のゆくよう努力している点なぞ、既成宗教とはちがった、また、他の多くのいわゆる新興宗教とも異った観を示しているのは頼もしいが、大体この「世界救世教教義解説」なる小冊子からうかがわれるところでは、その教義を貫く根本思想ともいうべきもの、例えば、世界は大神の大愛によって創造され、従って愛と叡智による大いなる調和が、宇宙の生命であるとする如き、きわめて妥当穏健な世界観で、誰しもの共鳴するところにちがいないのである。たまたまいわゆる新興宗教、殊に、アプレゲールの邪宗怪教といッしょくたにされて、とかく事あれかしのジャーナリズムの槍玉に挙げられるのは、新興宗教として免れがたい運命かも知れないが、馬鹿々々しい話である。 （昭和二十六年七月記） メシヤ教について 新居 格 ――凡人日常生活への近親性―― わたしは、実をいうと、信仰ないし宗教（一部の）と無縁で過ごしてきた一人である。バイブルにも「イエス言いけるは、すこやかなる者は医者の助けを求めず、ただ病あるものこれを求む」（ルカ伝第五章三十一節）とあるように、わたしはからだが比較的壮健だったのと、呑気な性質から、宗教には全く縁なき衆生の一人だったといえる。 ところで、からだが弱く、軽い出血をして臥床二カ月半に及ぶと、さすがに平常の呑気さも力失せ、ひたすら聖書を読む身となった。 頭の病気だから長いものは読めないが、聖書の文句は短いので読むに耐えた。そして気にいった章句を口づさみながら横臥していた。聖書の中には多くの奇蹟がある。イエスが起てといえば足なえが起った。目くらの目があき、癩病やみがなおり、死者さえ蘇生する。まことに不思議であり、奇蹟である。 近代科学の常識では、解せないものが多い。そこでわたしは、イエスには、放射能の作用でもあるのではあるまいかと思った。 あるともいい切れないが、さりとて無いとも伝い切れないと思った。イエスが病める者悩やめる者を癒やしてゆけたのは、そうした放射能を具有していたのではあるまいか、とわたしはふと考えた。そうした仮定が許されるとしたら、イエスの行った奇蹟も全部とは云えないまでも、いくらかは解し易い気がしたからだ。 一方現代の科学の進歩過程は、全く驚異に値いするものがあって、原子爆弾、水素爆弾その他の進歩は、その歩みをとどめない。そうなると、これは科学であると共に、超科学的で神秘に近く奇蹟に類する。それでは人間が行った奇蹟の方は、不思議で神秘的だということにはならない。 いろいろの物質があり、元気があるようにいろいろの人間のあることだけは考えられる。 人間の身体の構造なども、精巧微妙なものであると共に、わたくしは病気中時計のような気がした。すると、お医者さんはその破損した時計をなおす時計修繕工みたいに思ったことである。そうなると、精巧微妙と信じ切っていた自分の身体が、時計みたいに安っぽくなり、その時計が動かなくなって停った時が死かというようにも思われて、精巧微妙の考え方が、急に安っぽくなったりした。わたしは人格的感化にも、一種の放射能性を認めたがる考えかたをしているが、そのことは肉体的方面にも考え得られることではないかとも思う。たとえは、掌療法といったものにも、そうした要素がありはしないかと思う。 それは肉体の放射能作用でゐるから、その機能をもつものには、自ら可能でそれは人格とか神格とは関係がない。そうした能力のあることを自覚すると、その人の意識には、特殊的なものが生じてくるらしいのは否定できない。 家の光教会の寮が、熱海来の宮の近くにある。でわたしは、しばしばその寮に静養に行ったことがある。その時に観音教の話を土地の人から聞いたことはある。 観音教がえらく壮んであることも耳にしたが、わたしはその堂宇が、どこにあるかも今もって知らない。宗熱海市長はわたしには懇意な間柄だが、宗市長と観音教との記事が、新聞に出ていたこともチラと見た。 観音教主の事件が、新聞に出ていたこともあったが、わたしは大凡そ社会面の記事には、興味がないので、共に読ますじまいである。わたしは今は、メシヤ教を称している以前の観音教の教説を知らない。教祖その人にも逢ったことはない。 時事週報の記者が来て新興宗教の尤なるものであるメシヤ教祖と対話せよといって頼まれたが、わたしはその新興宗教にたいして少しの知識もないので、ご免をこうむった。 好ききらいの感情からきたのではなく、何分にも知らないから、話すこともないからという理由でことわっただけだ。 正教といい邪教というその限界が、ハッキりしない。古くからあるから正教で、新興だからインチキだとはいえない。例えば、天動説は、紀元二世紀ごろから九世紀か十世紀間に行われていたから、それが正しく、地動説は、その後の新説だから正しくないということにはならない。正教邪教についても、同様のことがいえよう。わたしはメシヤ教祖の岡田氏が私の空想する人間的放射能の所有者であるかどうかは知らない。保持者であるかも知れないし、そうでないかもわからない。それは今のわたしにはなんともいえないし、その教説を聞いたこともないから、それに対してなんの意見ももち得ない。 しかしわたしは、自分が病気に倒れてから、ひどく宗教的傾向を帯び、生死の問題、年齢がもつ画線的段層を泌々感するようになったのは、事実である。そうなると、わたしはいかなる意味でもの、刺戟的なものには、嫌悪を感じ、ひたすらにしずかならんことを欲するに至った。 そのころである。畏友岩崎栄氏来りて、メシヤ教並に、その教組について書けよという。他ならぬ岩崎老の依頼だから、病中ながら執筆を快諾した。 わたしは、従容として死につくという壮観は欲するが、そんな芸当はわたしには出来そうも思われなかった。わたくしは苦しみ、もがきつゝみじめな死にかたをするような気がしてならなかった。が、それはそれだ。わたしが病気がどうにかよくなってからの、今後の生活――死に至るまでのそれは――きわめて善意に富んだ、正直な、美しい魂をもち、よき解釈をしてその日その日の送れる平凡な、善良人となればよい。それが今度の私の宗教生活だとしたい。 生きた人間の宗教であって、生きている間の宗教である。死生を超越するといった大それたものではない。苦しければ苦しいと叫ぶでもあろう、苦しいのに苦しくないなぞと、やせがまんはしない。わたしが病中聖書を読んで感動した点は、汝のあだを愛じそのために祈祷せよということで、わたしは憎むべきものをどこまでも愛したく思い、わたしの宗教は生けるものの生活の宗教で生死とか死後のそれではない。 メシヤ教の本領が、どこにあるかはわたしは知らない。ただ、それが生けるものの宗教であってほしいと心から念願するだけである。 メシヤ、その意は救世主である。かつてのイエスはそれであった。現代の熱海のメシヤは、どんな抱負をもち、どんな奇蹟を演じて救世しつゝあるか、今のわたしは少しも知らない。しかし、大本教の残薜だのインチキ性を必然に持つところの新興宗教と、一つの柵に入れて押しのけはしない。 冷静にその発展過程を見ていこうと思うだけだ。わたしは何ものに対しても成心をもっては臨まない。熱海のメシヤ教に対しても、同様に今はほめる材料もなければ、ケナス材料もない。 教祖は留置場などは大きらいで閉口したという話だが、それは当然で、留置場は、それがどんなに清潔であっても決して好ましいものではない。それを卒直にいうところに教組の、凡人性があって、ちょっと好ましい。宗教といったとてそれは何も偉大で崇高のスペクタルではない。宗教に非日常性を多くのぞむのは間違いで、それよりも凡人性に親近感があることが却ってのぞましい。何も空中の芸当をのぞむのではなく、凡人生活の苦悩や惑迷は、きわめて些々な日常性にある。で、それに対応するといった宗教が彼等に親しまれるのではないかと思う。 ところで私は、岩崎君が置いて行った岡田自観氏の著書を、病気のため全部読む気力がなかったのだが、氏の信仰雑話のうちの一文「奇蹟」と、病中たまたま読んでいたルアソの耶蘇伝第十六章奇蹟と、対照してみたかったのである。 岡田氏はいう「宗教に奇蹟は附物である。いな附物であらねばならない。観音教団に奇蹟が非常に多いことは、信徒諸氏の常に体験するところであろう」と。 だが私は、非常に多いといわれる奇蹟の何一つも知らない。しかし奇蹟によって信仰が深くなり、熱度が加わることも亦あきらかであることは、体験者の場合にはそうである。 ルアンはその著耶蘇伝に「一般の世間は、神の力が人間の中に、てんかん性、けいれん性の原理としてあることを実際希望していたのである。イエスが行なったと信ぜられている殆どすべての奇蹟は、病気を治す奇蹟である。多くの場合、優秀な人の接触が、薬剤の力に値しないと敢て誰れがいうだろうか。その人に会うという歓喜がそれを治すのである」 このことは私にもわかる。岡田氏の信徒にも同様のことが多くあるのであろう。それを奇蹟と言ってもいゝ。他の言葉で言ってもよい。岡田氏は、近代の宗教は奇蹟が少ないために、反って奇蹟に対して迷信呼ばわりする傾きがあるというのだろう。同感である。 またルアンの耶蘇伝によれは「当時猶太においては、今日なお近来におけるものゝ如く、即ち絶対に、個人的霊感に委したもので、少しも科学的ではなかった。すでに五世紀以前から希臘ではじめられた科学的の医薬は、イエス時代のパレスチナの猶太人には殆ど知られていなかった。こういう状態の裡に、病者を優しく労わり、感じ易い何かの暗示によって、快復の保証を与えてくれるすぐれた人が、傍にあることは、往々にして決定的の救済となるのである」 このことは、わたし自身の病気中にも経験したものである。 私はまだ岡田氏の奇蹟を経験していないから、とかくの詮議はしない。 たゞ、岡田氏とイエスとの相違は、イエスは奇蹟を施こしても、それについて「決して語るなかれ」といっている。 岡田さんは「観音教団には奇蹟が非常に多いことは、信徒諸士の常に体験するところであろう」と公言している。 どちらの態度がよいのか、それはわたしにはわからぬ。 岡田自観氏に望む 山岡荘八 宇宙は未知の分野の多すぎる科学だけではまだまだ解明されない。したがつて唯心論が一世を蔽う時もあれば、唯物論が世界をつゝむこともあろう。その時代々々の流行で、平家にあらざれは人にあらざる時があるのも止むを得まい。 といって、そうした世論に歩調も合せて宇宙そのものが唯心論者になったり唯物論者になったりしないことだけは確実である。 いかに世界の二大陣営がカンカンになって論議しようと、いかに原子爆弾をバラ撒こうと、そのために宇宙の実体が、その意志を変えることもあるまい。 宇宙の実体は、片々たる人間どもの認識などにはかゝわりなく厳として実在する。一日庭におりて、春に花をつけ、秋にみのる植物たちの営みに接するだけでも無限の感懐を禁じ得ない。 唯心論が向う鉢巻で唯物論を攻撃したり、科学と宗教が反撥しあったりする時代はすでにすぎ去ったと思う。物質のもとは電子であり、電子はすでに小宇宙であって、科学では解明しきれない霊的なものを含んでいる――ということを解明したのは科学であった。 お互いにひとりよがりはやめにして、敬虔に、次なる文明の建設に取りかゝらなければなるまい。 由来私は宗教家なる者の排他思想にはつくづく嫌悪を感じている。もし真理の探求ということが、未だ解明されざる宇宙の法則から、その意志をさぐることにあるとするならば、それをさぐりに入る門は無数にあってよい筈である。 キリストを介して入るがゆえに邪となり、仏を介して近づくがゆえに悪であるというようなおかしな論理はあり得まい。同時に日蓮の門から入ろうと、親鸞の門から歩き出そうと、その精神に励精がかけていたのでは、迷信の域を一歩も出られないことも事実であろうが、みなそれぞれに真理の登山口ではあろう。 しかしその真理の山は、われこそ頂上を極めたりと叫んだ人の声のみ残って、いまだに民衆のものではない。 民衆は手をひいて共に頂上をきわめ、四方の景観を見せられた後でなければ信じない。その意味からは、いまだ未踏の処女峰である。その険岨な処女峰の征服途上で、強力たちが目的を忘れてつかみあいの喧嘩をしている――といったのが、いまの宗教家だと私は思っている。 私は宗教と迷信を、その人のめざすもの、実体が、何であるかに依って区別している。 唯物論者がどんなに小賢しい物証を並べようと、唯心論者が、どんなにまかふしぎな祈祷をやらかそうと、そんなものとは厳として別に存在する宇宙の大意志。 その意志をさぐって救われようとするのならば、いかに見すぼらしい会員にも真の宗教が存在すると思うし、いかに大伽藍の奥で金襴の法衣をひけらかそうと、強力同志の喧嘩などを考えている手合いやそれを有難がるのは迷信の徒に違いない。その意味では、いかに迷信家が日本中にあふれているかという事にもなるが、その反対にかくれた宗教家もまた多いという事にもなろう。 大体古いものはみな真物で、新しいものは偽物といった妙な事大主義が明治この方日本人の宗教観に、かなり大きくつきまとっている。 勿論これはインテリと称する者の間にだが、これらの人々の宗教を礼装の装飾位に考えた安易な人生観が、古いものの権威と尊厳をいちじるしく低めたようだ。安易な容認はつねに内容の腐敗低下をうながすからである。 岡田自観氏の観音教は、前に記した宇宙の意志を「愛――」と「調和――」と見たところに出発しているようである。その出発に私は異義をさしはさむ何ものも持っていない。私は宇宙を人も物もふくめた一つの生命体と観て、そこにわがさゝやかな安住の場を見つけ出している。したがって物を公平に分配しようという共産主義にも、腕に任せて取るがよいという資本主義にも賛成出来ない。もともと物と人とは一体であって、つねに一体の努力が更に新しい物質（科学）や又文化を産みだして人間生活を豊富にすべきもの――と、考えているからである。 その意味では組合主義などとも、キリスト教ともいさゝか違うと思っている。さまざまな物資や領土が人類のためにあると考えると、人と物とは二元になって、人類はやがてまた物資を求め、領土をねらって闘争を繰返すことになるが、もともと一体なのだからと考えるとだいぶ考え方は違って来る。 植物のない世界に動物のあろう筈はなく、水のないところに空気のあろう筈もない。資本家だけがあっても仕事にならず、労働者ばかりでも高度の生産はのぞめない。 自分があるということはすでに他があるということで、他と自己とは原子に至ってはっきりと一つであることが証明された。 換言すれは個々は原子の小となり、大は一個の宇宙となる万物をふくめた一つの生命体であることは、今日よでの文明が探り得た動かすべからざる事実なのである。 この事実に基づいて、新しく人間の生前を規正してゆくのでなければ、人類ばかりでなく他の生産までが滅亡するかも知れない危機に見舞われている。 そしてこの危機感もまた、一つの生命体であるがゆえに、各大陸から各国家、各民族、各個人にまでことごとく滲透して、現代社会の絶望を構成している。 したがってこうした危機の感受出来ない宗教家などというものは、すでに宗教家ではなく、知って動けなけれは廃物というより他にない。 （何と日本中に廃物の多いことか！） 岡田自観氏はこの危機感からます信者を救おうとして起ちあがり、病と貧と争いなき世界を建設すると宣言している。 これも不賛成を称える理由はない。ショウペンハウエルがさまざまな法則を目して「宇宙の盲目意志――」といったその「意志――」を大愛と調和の神の意志と見た以上、当然これは生れて来なけれはならない宗教家の悲願のはずである。 病と貧と争い―― 私はまだそれほど深く自観氏を知らない。したがってこの三大眼目の実行が、どのようにしてなされるかの詳細にはふれ得ないが、しかし、熱海にまず、その三つを無くした「地上天国――」の粗本を建設しようとして、土木工事を起していることは聞いている。死せる伽藍、信徒おどしの過去の伽藍にならぬよう、大いに深遠なる経倫を示してもらいたいと思っている。 世の中にはよく釈尊やキリストやその他の開祖たちなどを超俗的な隠者風になぞらえ、宗教とは政治の上に超然すべきかのごとき言辞を弄して、自己の無力を隠蔽している偽聖者が存在するが、キリストにしても釈尊にしても、おれは救世主だとは云ったが宗教家だとは云っていない。 政治を度外視した救世などがあり得るかどうか、曲言も甚だしいものだと思っている。 世を救おうと宣言するほどの気魄の者は、今日の言葉で云えば、革命家でなければならない。 政治・経済、芸術、学問、すべてに新しい見識と意気をもって、行詰った過去の文明とそれにまつわる権力を破砕するのでなけれは、天国など建設出来る筈はない。 釈尊は立派な革命家であった。キリストも権力の前などには一歩もひざまづかなかった。 たゞ濁世を憂い、救世の悲願を行動してやまなかった、大哲人であり、大政治家であり、大芸術家であった。 岡田自観氏の霊魂がその高きよりくだり、叡智これ伴うならば、すでに時間の問題になっている唯物論的科学文明時代の最後に啓示された、原子文明時代の扉を逞しくおし開いて貰いたい。 宇宙の意志を神の大愛と見る点では、ことごとく氏と同感の私には、今こそ神は、そうした使徒の出現を両手をひらいて待ちうけているのである。 観音教について 遠藤慎吾 今は、たしか世界メシヤ教とかいうのだそうだが、私が観音教のことを知ったのは、もう十年以上も昔のことである。と言ってもその当時、観音教と称していたかどうか、実は、その点もはっきりしない。何しろ、私達は、あの（一種独特の掌療法のことを「チチンプイプイ」と呼び慣わしていた。こういう名前を発明したのは、里見トン[弓享]先生で、従って、掌療法そのものを私に紹介して下さったのも、無論里見先生である。先生が、どなたの紹介で、こういう療法に興味を持つようになられたのかは知らない。ともかく、やってみたところが、先生の永年の痼疾であった痔がすっかり直ったので、この療法を信用するようになられたのだと思う。注射が体に毒を残すもので絶対にいけないということ、発熱は、体内に貯った悪いものが、外へ出ようとして起る現象だということ、それに、この治療を始めて暫らくすると起る下痢のことなどを、初めて話して下さったのも先生である。この療法の理論の基礎になってる、「浄化作用」という言葉も、先生から始めて聞いて、何となく奇妙な愛嬌のある言葉だと思った。と言っても近代的な教養を受けていられる里見先生が、この魔呵不思議な理窟を心から信用していられたわけではない。 「こいつをやってれば、肥料なしで米が育つ、爆弾も落ちて来ないとあると、一寸いけないがね、しかし面白いところもあるよ」 と言ってニヤニヤ笑っていられた。 私も、先生から治療を受けたが、たしかに気持がよい。肩のこりなどは、軽くなったような気がする。私は、昔マルキシズムに心酔したことがあり、どことなく唯物弁証法的な考え方が残っていて、無神論者ではなかったが、少くとも非常に合理主義的なものの考え方をする。だから、民間療法などは非常に軽蔑している。ところが、その一方、現代の科学というものの絶対性をも信じていない。科学にはまだまだ判らないところが沢山あると思っている、殊に医学の領域では、紳経系統の作用が病気に及ぼす影響については、殆んど研究されて居らんと思っている。病気が或る程度、神経の作用で直るのも、実は神経系統の機能に対する研究の不十分さから来るもので、この研究さえ十分進めば、立派に科学的な説明がつくと信じている。だから、この掌痺法みたいな、一種の神経療法、つまり紳経系統を刺激して病気を直す方法は、科学の進まぬ現在では、存在する値打があるという風な実に奇妙な独断論を抱いている。だから、掌療法そのものは、少しも信用せす、軽蔑していながら、その効用は認めているという始末である。 里見先生は、わたしみたいな、おかしな合理主義者ではないが、いくらか私と似た考え方をして居られたのではないかと思う。ともかく、或る種の病気が直る事は事実で、理窟の方はおかしくて信用出来ぬところが多いが、病気治療に効くという厳然たる事実だけは認めないわけには行かぬのである。 里見先生に何度も治療して頂いて、非常に気持がよいと言ったものだから、それでは、君か、君の女房がこの療法の講習を受け、治療を会得したらどうだということになった。 そめ時分、私は麹町の六番町に住んでいて、すぐ斜め向いが、里見先生の御宅であった。ところが、ほど近い平河町に、新しくチチンプイプイの先生が開発した。これは、商大を卒業したとかいう、若いインテリ治療師であったが、そこで講習が開かれることになり、里見先生の親友である三浦さんや小生の女房も、この講習に参加した。私は、霊の力などは少しも信用せず、チチンプイプイなどは、一種の神経療法だから、高い講習料を払って、岡田教組の御親筆などを頂戴せずとも、女房から方法さえ習えば、それでよいと思っていたので、講習には参加しなかった。 ところが、その若いインテリ先生が、先祖の霊がどうだとかこうだとか、私の住んでいるこの家には絶対に爆弾は落ちませんとか（その頃は戦火まさにたけなわで、空襲が段々と激しくなりつゝある時だった）、あまりおかしなことを言うとのことなので、これはいけませんわい、と思い始めたのだが、果せるかな、三浦さんは、とうとう腹を立て、講習を受けるのをやめてしまった。 でも、里見先生は、「余り生鼻面目に考えるからいかんのだよ」と笑って、相変らすチチンプイプイを続けていられた。先生は、確かにチチンプイプイの名人で、先生にやって頂くと、気持がよくなって、きいたような気がするのである。ところが、小生の女房がやるとそうは行かぬ。一向にきかないのである。尤も、これは、小生が女房を余り尊敬して居らなかったせいかもしれぬ。 このチチンプイプイは、当時陸海軍の軍人たちに大変ファンが多かったという話を聞いた。陸軍士官学校の校長をしていた人が、チチンプイプイの大変な信者で、この治療法を学生たちに教えようとしたことがあった。すると軍医たちから苦情が出た。日本の陸軍は科学的な装備を持った、近代的な軍隊である。医療にしても近代的な科学的療法を採用して居る。しかるに、士官学校で怪しげな民間療法を教授するとは、何事であるかというわけである。そこで、大問題となって、軍医の高官が士官学校々長と相会して会議を開いた。（これは、噂話でデマくさい臭もするので、真偽のほどは保証しがたいが）ともかく、士官学校々長は、陸軍病院の既に久しく採用して居る科学的医療法を認めないのかとつめよられた。そこで校長は無論自分は科学的庭療法を信頼する、しかし、今は容易ならぬ激戦の時であって、陸軍将兵は病院はおろか、一人の軍医もいないような僻地へも進撃して居る。絶海の孤島などの戦いで、薬箱一つないような場合さえ考えられる。そういう場合に傷病兵はどうしたらよいか。その時にこそ、このチチンプイプイを役立たせようとして、自分は学生たちにこれを教えさして居るのである、と大見得をきったというのである。 当時の日本陸軍の姿をしのばせる、皮肉なエピソードとして見ると、一寸面白い試である。 敗戦後、私にとっては、甚だ懐しく、かつ愛嬌にみちた「チチンプイプイ」が、新興宗教として隆々たる勢威を示し始めたのには驚いている。 でも、世界メシヤ教などというれいれいしい名前を聞いても、どうも私にはピンと来ない。私にとっては、いつまでたっても、やはり、懐しく、愛すべき「チチンプイプイ」である。そしてそれでよいのだと思っている。 教祖の印象 大場さち子 教祖岡田茂吉氏の法難顛末記「新しき暴力」に、読後感をよせたのを機縁として、親しく教祖におあいしたのは、八月三十一日のことである。意外に早い秋の訪れが感じられる日で、朝から小雨が降ったり、やんだりしていたが、箱根の強羅についてからも、雨霧は晴れず、もうもうたる一面の霧にとざされて、山上の視界は遮られていた。その霧にぬれて、紫のあじさいや、白い芙蓉の花がひそやかに咲いているのが、眼にしみた。ともすればすべりがちな山の岩道を登りつめた高台に、新築されたばかりの日光殿と、それをとりまいて、奇岩巨石に流泉の美をこらした神苑が、地上天国はかくやとばかりに、私達一行を迎えてくれた。 この新しい信仰の殿堂は、建築に関して、一片の知識ももたない私の眼にも決して何作りとか、何様式とかいわれる業々しいものでないことがはっきりとわかった°われわれの住居を広くしただけの建物にすぎないのであるが、その内部へ一歩ふみ入つた瞬間に、何となく心がひきしまり、頭の下がるような思いがしたことは、うそではない。それは一本の柱、一枚の板にも、五十万信徒の霊魂がこもっていたせいであろうか、広間も小間も廊下も、至るところが清浄で、素朴で、どこにも余分の装飾がないのだ。神苑もやっぱりその通りで、御案内していただいた阿部氏のお話では、教祖が御神意のままに指揮され、信徒の労力奉仕で築かれたのだそうである。そういえば、一つの岩、一樹のかげにも、人間の誠意がこもっているように感じられる。びっくりするような大きな岩を配置しながら、少しも威圧を感じさせず、どこまでも明るく、自然で、すがすがしい。 私はもうそれだけで、教祖の人格にふれたような気がした。案の定、応接間で直接向い合った教祖は、親しみ深い小父さんといった感じで、教祖だの、生神様だのという言葉からくるいかめしいポーズも、神秘めいた姿態もない。いかにもざっくばらんで、話し好きな方であった。 美術骨董に高い鑑識眼をもっていられることは、徳川夢声氏の問答有用で、すでに知っていたが、この日も話は古美術から始まり、お手もとに秘蔵されている朝鮮の古鉢や、井戸の茶碗を見せて、なみなみならぬ深い造詣を示されたが、それも教えてやるといった高飛車なものでなく、美術の話をすることが、心からたのしくてたまらない御様子である。 そこから出発して、メシヤ教の教義やら、信仰の話にはいって行ったのであるが、私のような不信の、徒が、一番関心をもつているのは、御浄霊による治病の奇蹟である。 この日の世話役をひきうけて下さった岩崎氏は、私を医薬の盲信者のようにいわれるが、なるほど私の座右には、錠剤や注射薬がおいてないことはなく、どこへ行くにも薬持参で、正に中毒症状の一歩手前であるけれど、私は実は大して医者も薬も信用していないのである。医者は私のような病弱な体を名づけて、虚弱体質だの、惨出性体質だのといい、治療の方法はないという。これ程ずるい逃避はないのだが、これによって、科学の合理性に立脚した医学にも、限界があり、生命の紳秘は到底現在の医学で究明し得られないことを証明している。 岡田教祖は「医学は迷信だ」と、断定された。 これを言葉通りにうけとってはならないだろう。新興宗教をさして、十ぱ一からげに迷信で片づけたがる人々に対する教組の抗議であり、余りにも唯物主義に傾いた人々へ、逆説的に唯心主義を強調されたのだと私は見ている。われわれの世代の不幸は、あらゆる物事を信ずることよりも、先ず疑うことから出発するように訓練されていることだ。人間の掌から光を発し、それが病巣に作用して治病の効果をあげるということも全面的に信じない代り、医薬万能で、健康を買いとることも出来ないと思っている、ところがメシヤ教の信者は事実御浄霊で病気を癒しているし、戦争中中国の農民は、日本の軍医から渡された馬糞をこねた丸薬をのまされて、けろりと難病が癒っているのだ。ここに人間の精神に宿る神秘な力が働く。御浄霊が幾多の奇蹟を生んで、医薬では治療出来なかった病気を癒しているのは、それを施す人と、施される人との間に、信仰という精神の交流が、電気のように感電し合うところから起るのである。 信仰の話となると、教祖の瞳には、異常な光が宿った。人間岡田氏から、とたんに教祖の座に直り、霊的な存在となって、私の心に迫ってきた。この凡にして非凡、非凡にして凡――そこに五十万信徒が教祖と仰ぐ岡田氏の魅力と偉大さがある。われわれはもはやこけおどしの金ピカ衣裳や、金ピカ御殿にはだまされない眼をもっているのだ。 人間岡田茂吉のプロフィル 岩崎 栄 岡田氏を最初に訪問したとき、それは朝礼というのか、お参りというのか、なんと称するのか、とにかくきまった行事なのだろう。熱海清水町の本部で、何百人かの信徒を前に、氏が教えを説いているところだったが、私は、へえ！これが教祖さまといわれる人か」と大いにアテがはずれたような、妙な気持になった。 ちっとも教祖らしくない、たゞのおじさんだったからだ。「教祖らしい」というのはどんなタイブかと反問されては、ちょっと表現に苦しむけれど、ともかくわれわれの頭には、一つの概念みたいに、宗教、宗団の中心人物、生き神様なぞという人物に対する、或る種の型が出来上っている。それは必ず衣冠束帯、そして長髪の神主型か、或いは袈裟ころもの坊さん型かにきまっているのだ。いすれにしても、いかにも尤もらしく、おごそかに、いかめしく構えて、一壇高い座のミスの内側かなにかに隠れて、もっともらしい神秘な声で、凡人にはわけもわからぬ御託宣をくだしていなければならぬものとなっている。 然るに、メシヤ教――あの当時は観音教のお光りさまだったが――の教祖さまは、白髪を短かく苅り込んで、渋い和服姿で、まるで隣組会長が常会に臨んで、近所合壁の衛生や病気の相談にあずかっているかの如き態度だったから大いにアテがはずれ、何だか肩透かしをくったみたいな気持にされたわけだった。 しかもこの人は、いさヽか巻舌口調の、いかにもザックバランな、たゞの江戸ツ児、下町のおじさんといったタイプなんだ。 説話の間にも、ベランメエ調がとぴ出し、シャレや冗談を言っては、アハヽヽと笑い、従って信者の男女もゲラゲラと笑いこけていたりする風景だった。 要するに私は、この人のすべてから、意想外に無造作で、率直なのに呆れながらも、第一印象としては、かなりな好感を寄せることが出来たのであった。 その常会みたいなものが終ったあと、その広間で映画の会がはじまった。私はこのことにもいさゝか驚かされた。しかし、この映画というのは、たぶん、教義を画面で見せるような教材用的な文化映画に類するものだろうと思って、係りの者に訊いてみると、そうではなく、普通の洋画や日本物だという。誰れが見るのかと訊いたら、教祖大先生夫妻がごらんになるのだが、一ぱん信徒も見せていたゞくのだとのことだった。 暗くなった広間は男女の信者で一ぱいだった。その中にまじって、岡田氏と夫人とが坐っている。夫婦はいろいろと映画の話をしている。夫婦ともかなり映画通らしいことを云い交わしている。私はこゝでもちょっと意外な感じを抱かされた。トンデモハップンのミイハァ階級が喜ぶ映画を、この生き神さまと呼ばれる老人もやはり、心から観賞しているということ――これは、この教祖は、市井に居る使徒だ。われわれの生活の中で一緒になって泣いたり笑ったりしている教祖、ナザレのイエスもこんなにして、熊さんや辰さんと伍しながら、天国は近づけりなぞと教えていたのだろうが、いま日本のこの熱海にもそうした宗教家が居る。面白いナ、と私はなんだか心の底が、ほのぼのと温かくなってくる思いだった。 「私ア何も、別に生き神さまでも何でもありませんよ。自分でそんなことを考えたり、主張したりしたことは決してありやせん。たゞ私は救世主、神さまの使徒なんです。救世済民のために、神がお使いになる道具、この私は神さまの道具みたいなものだと思ってるわけでさ」 初対面の言葉だった。 「なんだか物足りないようですけど」 「なにがですか」 「なんとなく、あよりにお手軽過ぎますね」 「いや、なにこれがありのまゝなんで」 「ありのまゝ過ぎますね。在来の教祖、管長さまなぞと称する人物はですね、もっと芝居がかった、大袈裟な雰囲気をこさえ、その奥の院に神々しく控えてござる、というのが、一般の通念じゃないですか」 「いかにも、いや、私の部下のうちにも、以前はよく、そうした神さまがかったやり方の方が得策ですなぞというものもいましたがね、どうしても私は、そんなお芝居は、やる気になれないんでね」 彼は父祖五六代、れんめんたる江戸ツ児だという。いかにもそうらしいところがある。江戸ッ児なぞというもの、なにもそう偉いもんじゃないじゃないかという人もあるだろうが、ご尤もだ。江戸ッ児なんていうもの、決して偉くはない。しかし、その偉くないところが即ち江戸ッ児の身上なのだ。泥くさい田舎ッペというものはすぐ偉くなる。偉いようなポーズを好む。何事にも事大主義で、鬚をはやしたがる。代議士になりたがる。 なにをいッてやンでえ、こンちくしょう。モタモタと変にシャッチョコ張りヤがって、そっくりけえりヤがって、フン、カマボコオてんぶらにしたみてえなつらァしやがってサ、チャンチャラオカシイや。 形式的な事大主義者に対する江戸ッ児の啖呵は、たいていこうした口調である。 江戸ッ児というものは、たゞそれだけ、あるがまゝのものなのだ。要するに善人なのだ。ゼイロクの如くにアクドクないのだ。東北人や九州人の如くに強豪でないのだ。早く言えばモロイのだ。弱い人間なのだ。その代り、アクがない。底意地の悪さもない。裏も表もない。正直で率直だ。純真で子供みたいなところがある。すぐうれしがる。すぐ淋しがる。すぐ笑う。すぐ泣く。おウ、めッぽう寒イや。たまらねえや、おウ、ばかに嬉しいじゃアねえか、ワッショイ。よウ、なんてことオいやァがるンだ。ヤケに悲しくッてこてえられねえゾ、こんちくしょうめ――といったしだいのセンセイたちである。 こうした人種の一人が、岡田茂吉氏であるということを発見して、私は実に愉快だった。何か荒涼とした人世に、真実のものを一粒掘りあてたような気持になった。 江戸ッ児にはしかし、妙にまたえこじなところがある。なんでも型を破りたがるような気風をもっている。一種のアマノジャクである。アマノジャクといえば、釈迦にしろキリストにしろ、大いにアマノジャク的な要素をもっていたが――なにしろ江戸ッ児は、お湯に入って、人が熱いといえば、なんでえ、こんなのはヒナタ水みてえじゃねえか、メッポウぬるイや。もっとドンドン燃してくんねえ……なぞと、シカメッ面をして、向う鉢巻で、呻りながら茹で蛸みたいになって頑張る。岡田茂吉氏にも、宗教家として、確かにそうした型破りのところが大いにあると思う。彼れの、信者を集めての説教が、まるで型破りの、いかにも江戸ッ児らしい皮肉と啖呵の連発なのだ、たとえば、 ――共産党の徳田球一、あの徳田球一氏が、ナニオ、ベラボーめ、共産党にャ事務局かなんぞ無えッてんだ。と議会でフンゾリ返ッているが、あの調子だと、この次ぎには、なにオッ、世の中にャ共産党なンか無えッてんだ。なにオッ、トクキュウなんて人間は無えッてんだ！と吼えながら、どこかへ消えてしまうだろう。アハヽヽ―― ――新聞をみると、流行性感冒の罹病者がナント十数万人も出来たという、しかし、数字の大袈裟なのはあたりめえよ。それ、インフレエンザッていうじやないか、アハヽヽ―― ――新聞屋なぞ、わが教えをインチキだというが、御利益のある宗教がインチキで、御かげも何もない宗教が正しいということになると、救われない宗教が正信で、天国に行くのがインチキで、地獄に堕ちるのが正教ということになる。かつて大本教のお筆先に曰く、世はサカサマになりて居るゾヨ――アハヽヽ―― ――本教で米の増収に努力するのはアタリメエだよ。ソレ飯屋教。アハヽヽ―― 等 等、といったふうのものである。 去年の夏、長い法難のあと、漸く熱海に帰って来た岡田氏に、私は慰問と激励の手紙を送った。その返辞が岡田氏から来た。 ――お手紙拝見致しました。いろいろの御忠言有難く候。なにぶん取調べ峻厳を極わめしため、頭脳に支障を来たし、原稿も書き得ざる始末に有之、当分静養につとめ、快復致したる上にて、方針を樹てるより致し方なくと存じ居り候―― 正直のところ、私はこの返辞に接したときは「なアんだ。ひどくイクジのないことをいう男だナ」と思って、実はガッカリしたのであった。 まず常識として、生き神さまや、生き仏さまが、あのような法難から帰って来たとして、信者たちの前に、どんな表現をするか。 ――なアに、ビクともしなかったよ。神をおそれぬか！と一喝してやったよ。アハヽヽ、アハヽヽ―― まずそんなところだろう。そこで善男善女がいよいよ感激し「ありがたいことでございます。ナムアミダプ、ナムアミダプ……」と合掌礼拝することになる。 ところが岡田氏は、その手記にも率直に書いているが、 「ドヤドヤと武装警官が、私の宅に踏み込んだとき、胸がドキドキした。落ちつけなかった。朝飯が不味く、やっと我慢して一杯ですました」 警察の取調べをうけて、 「私はあまりの侮辱に涙がこみ上げてくるのをどうしようもなかづた」 「私は、焦慮、煩悶、憤怒、絶望――頭は困惑の極に達し、グラグラとあたり一面大きな渦巻となり、烈しい眩暈がおこり視覚がなくなり、意識が朦朧として気が狂いそうになった瞬間、人事不省に陥ってその場に昏倒してしまった」 「私は縮み上って声すら出ない。恐怖で体は石の如く、自己意識すらない。たゞ平グモのようにヘタバッて一心にあやまるばかり、申しわけありません。どうかお許し下さい。私は馬鹿でした……くりかえしつゝ滂沱として流るゝ涙をどうすることも出来なかった」 こうしたことを、これは何万かの信者に読ます手記だが、彼は実に率直に書き綴っている。どこに生き神さまの威厳があろうぞ。どこに大教主のポーズがあろうぞ。まるで子供のように純真素直なのである。童心――そうだ。まったく童心だ。 この童心に、神が宿るのだ。メシヤの心がうつるのだろう。 信者との問答 岡田自観師と信者とが、一問一答の応酬をしている光景というものは、恰も、慈父を取り巻く愛児の、その一団の語らいにも似ており、また恩師と生徒たちの質疑応答とも見られる異観であり、壮観である。 「私は毎日、一時間を定めて、数百人の信徒に面接し、いかなる難問でも、疑問でも持ち出しなさいといってありますので、多いときには、この一時間に数十、数百の質問が殺到することさえあるのですが、私がそれに答え得なかったという場合は殆どありません。 もちろん、毎日、人ごとに異った質問なのです。そして偶には、私の知らないような質問も飛び出すのですが、やはりこれは私が答えるのでなく、神が私をして答えしめ給うのですから、どんな難問にあっても、即座にその答うべきことがらが私の頭脳に閃き、すぐとそれが言葉になり、口を突いて出るという状態なのですから、私は、その私の答えたことによって、あゝそういうものかなアと、私が教えられて感心するような、奇妙な現象もあるわけなのですよ と、まったく奇妙な言葉を、彼自身の口から聞いたことがある。 その「お伺い」と称する問答の代表的なものを拾ってみよう。 ――――――――――――――――――――――――― 「問」二十二年度国勢調査の結果にみても婦人に長命が多いのは何故でしょう。 「答」一家を支える主人即ち父親の方が一番身体を大事にする故早死する。大事にする息子程弱いし、どうでもいいと思う子供は丈夫である。今迄の健康法は逆であったのだ。故に体は打棄っておいた方が長命である。 「問」音楽もそれを弾く人の想念によって言霊のような働きをなすものでしょうか。 「答」勿論そうである。器楽を通じて指先からその人の霊が音律へ入ってゆく。笛など息から、入る。故に音楽でも人格や、信仰のある人のは感じよい。ラジオでもその人の霊がラジオを通じて働く。喋舌る声なども大いに影響する。ある地点にいて私が喋舌る言葉は全世界にひびく。どこでもとは言えぬ、その位置により違う。霊界には所々に高天原があり、都会もある。熱海、箱根も高天原である。そこで喋舌ることは日本中へひびく。以前東京丸ノ内の中央亭で時々講話をした。丸の内は◎で、その中央で大いに意味がある。今その時話したことが日本中に実現しつつある。 「問」西洋人の生れ変りがあるとのこと、その霊は西洋の方から来るの、でしょうか。又西洋人の生れ変りがありましょうか。 「答」どちらもある。アメリカ人など日本人の生れ更りが随分沢山ある。以前西部劇の有名な映画俳優でロローというのがあったが、日本人そっくりだ。例えば外人で日本へ来た者、日本人の妻君をもった者が、その因縁で死後日本へ憧れ生れてくる。日本人でもアメリカに憧れたものはアメリカ人として生れるのである。 「問」自由主義の世になり、婦人の社会進出が目覚しくなって来ましたが、その正しい在り方について。 「答」女は原則として家庭を治め、子供を産み、育てるのが本来の使命である。然し封建時代は、余りに女性を認めなさ過ぎ、不公平であったから、神様は今迄より権利を与えて下されたのである。然し外で働く女性もなくてはならぬ。勿論少数は必要である。代議士になる女性はそういう意味である。東洋は経であり、西洋は緯が本来であるが、五六七世になると東洋は今少しく婦人は上へ行き、西洋は今少し下へ行く事となり、ちょうどよくなるのである。 「問」老人と若大婦との同居と別居はどちらが宜しいでしょうか。 「答」別居の方が本当である。子供が成年になれば親から離れるのが本当である。動物でも歩ける様になれは離れる。あまり長く親の傍にいると子供の活動力が伸びない。 「問」現在三十五歳の婦人、娘を連れて再婚、一年程前より月経停止、それより体の調子悪くその頃よりお乳が出るようになり、搾れば今でも出るそうです。主人は先妻との間に一子が出来たが、産後二三日で他界、先妻の方でも主人の方でもこれを祭ってないとの事です。お乳の出るのと死んだ子供との間に何か霊的関係がありましょうか。 「答」子供の霊が祀ってないため、後妻である此人に憑いた。赤児は乳をのみたいので祖霊の中の正守護神が霊的の乳を出して霊の子供に飲ませる。それがいくらか物質化して現実の乳となると解釈すべきである。早く祀らないと色々な事をやる。肩がはる場合、赤子の霊がおぶさることがよくある。乳にブラ下る事もある。そういう場合も赤児の霊が吸うからいくらか乳が出る。 以前悲しくもないのに涙が出る人があった。この人は流産したのが祀ってなかった。それを教えてやったらその場で気持よくなった。これは流産した子供が憑いていた。 「問」夫婦で妻の縁類の方は次々と御教修を頂きますが、主人の方は一向に頂かない場合がありますが如何なる訳でしょうか。 「答」霊統の関係である。こういうのは妻君の霊統に因縁あり、その多くはその霊統の組先のうちに熱心な観音様を信仰している人のある為で話が判り易く、その霊が手伝うからそういう信仰の人は成蹟がよい。 「問」建築の場合、棟木を継合せる時、頭と頭を継合せると長男に障ると申しておりよすが何か訳がありましょうか。 「答」これは尾と頭尾と頭と繋ぐのが本当で、切った木でもなお霊が残っているからである。凡て逆は不可である。だから私など部屋に品物をおくにも法に叶った置き方をする。よく神様の本の上に小説などをおくと何か障りがある。すべてに順序がある。以前宝山荘にいた頃ある部屋へ入ると誰でも気持が悪くなる。これも調べてみると私の色紙の上に普通人のかいた色紙がのせてあって、順序が間違っていたので、取除いたら何ともなくなった。よく階段の上から目下に挨拶される時は困るので、私は急いでその人の位置まで上って挨拶をする。凡ゆるものに法がある。言葉でも仕事でもそうである。木なども格のある木とないのとあり、格のあるのは庭の上座に植える。私の造る庭はそういう点に注意してあるから、気持がよいのである。言葉に順逆がある。心得ていると自然人に好感を持たせる。「法に叶う」とはその事を言うのである。今の世の中で政治でも人事一般がうまくゆかないのはそういう点が出鱈目であるからである。 「問」原始時代と原子時力時代とは文化の基礎は非常に異っておりますが、新時代への出発と言う意味に於て多くの共通点を有している様に思われますが、御教示をお願い致します。 「答」これも一理ある。今は新文化の原始時代である。以前のは人間の出来たての本当の原始時代であったが、今度は人間が一大飛躍して高等動物となる。その原始時代でこれからは今迄のように喧嘩したり噛み合いしたりするような動物性をなくし本当の平和時代になるのである。 「問」五六七時代に於ける易学の価値に就て御説明をお願い致します。 「答」易学などは殆んどなくなる。吉凶禍福は人間の霊が曇っているため邪神邪霊に負けるからである。人間の霊が浄くなると暴力も強まり邪神に犯されなくなるから、凶禍はなくなる道理である。故にミロクの世は迷信的の事がなくなる。迷信が生れるのは精神的弱さからである。科学の教える通りにやっても凶事や禍がある。そこで恐怖を抱く。そこに迷信が発生する。その中一番怖いのは病気である。ミロクの世には恐怖心がなくなるから、迷信はなくなる。方位方角などもなくなる。これから本教も一切の迷信をなくするようにする。世界で迷信の種類の一番多いのはドイツである。科学の一番発達した国に多いのも不思議だ。科学の中にも迷信の部分が沢山ある。科学よりも治る本教浄霊は実は真の科学であり、迷信打破である。治れば迷信ではない。治らなけれは迷信である筈である。 「問」蚤や蚊に喰われますと先天的に甚しく腫れ苦しむ人と左程苦痛を感じない人とあり、又負ける人の方へよく喰いつきますが、これは如何なる訳でしょうか。 「答」普通虫に負けるというのは毒素の多い人で、刺された刺戟によってそこへ毒が集まる。つまりそれは疥癬も同じである。然し毒が非常に多くても浄化力の弱い人は毒素が固まっているから蚊も刺さないのである。 「問」稲荷大明神、また○○明神等と明神なる言葉を用いますが、明神に就て、また天王様、天神様とは如何なる御神格の神様でしょうか。 「答」明神――最初は偉い神様などにつけていたが、それがだんだん出鱈目になった。こうう事が世の乱れる元になる。下の位の者が上の位の神の名を犯したりしている。それが人間界へ移って位の上の人が下へ落ちたり、下の人が潜上の位置になったりいろいろ乱れた。 天王天神も同様尊んだ訳である。彼の菅原道真を天神などとつけたのは、道真が死後懺者に対して憤り・竜神となり雷火によってそれらを傷けた。ついに紫宸殿へまでも落雷したので慌てゝ祭ったので、そのため天神とつけたものであろう。 次に天王であるが天は印度名で、毘沙門天、弁財天など言い王もやはり印度語であり、孔雀明王、愛染明王などと言う。それから起ったものであろう。 「問」白血球と赤血球の関係について。 「答」血液の中に毒素があり、それが浄化によって血液中の微子の養分だけが白血球になる。それが膿である。 「問」四十一歳の男子、太陽の直射は勿論、傘等で光線を避けても熱気のため全身が段々熱くなり苦痛が増し、特に直射の個所は腫れ、後に薄皮と共に血の固まりがはげます。夏季は特に症状が甚しく、又七八年前よりは火にあたりましても、寒さにあいましても身体が温まりますに従いその症状を呈します。以上の症状は霊的に何か関係がありましょうか。又治癒致しましょうか。 「答」之は霊的ではない、何か特別の毒血の為で、親とかおじいさんなど変な薬を飲んだものであろう。よく鶴の紅点とか虎の爪、猿の睾丸などのむといいなどというが、そういう変なものをのんだ毒素である。 「問」大阪市のある理髪店で奥の間の御神体に対し善言讃詞をお唱えすると店の客が絶えます。ある霊憑りが表を沢山の亡者がうろうろしていて、お唱えの声が聞えるとその家の前に立塞がり現界人も出入が出来なくなる。入口の戸を開けお入りなさいと言い、お浄めをすれば亡者が救われに家の内に入り、又お客も入ることが出来ると申し、事実客が絶えます毎にその通り致しますとお客が参ります。他人に奇異の感を抱かせる事にもなりよすので如何致しましたら宜しいでしょうか。 「答」これは本当である。善言讃詞を上げると亡者の霊が集まる。そしてそれを聞く毎に一段一段向上する。霊は有難いから外の霊を勧誘しつれてくる。そういう事で本教は発展するので構わず続けてよい。亡者も無限ではない。又客の祖先など少しでも因縁のある人でなくては来れぬからでみる。その代り何れ霊はお礼するので繁昌する事となる。 「問」俗に福助、医学上では脳水腫と謂われる者は霊的のものと存じますが、如何なる原因によるのでしょうか。 「答」霊的も少しはあるが大体体的である。頭へ水が溜っているのである。浄霊で治る。霊的のものは治るのと治らぬのとある。これは前の世に頭をぶって非常に内出血して死んだのと、今一つは水死の際水を呑み逆さになったのとこの二つの生れ代りである。霊の憑依ではない。 「問」憑依した霊は霊界を脱出するでしょうか。又霊界に帰り神様に処罰されるでしょうか。 「答」無論霊界を脱出する。霊が地獄を脱出する時は火の車に乗って来る。火の車は地獄のバスのようなもので、霊は既に死んでいるからとても苦しいが苦痛だけで死ぬ事はない。憑依の目的が良ければ大した事はないが、ただ無断脱出の罪は問われる。 「問」神経痛、頭痛及び尿量が天候に左右される理由。 「答」これは確に関係はあるが大した事はない。元来汗は小便と同じものであって、寒い時には冷えるので汗になって排泄されぬために小便が頻繁に出るのである。女学生には太っているのが多いが、それは学校へ行って小便を我慢する癖がついている。そのため尿が腎臓から外部へ滲出してそれが身体へ溜る。それで身体が太るので健康体と誤られ易いが、実は俗にいう小便太りであってこれが病気の原因になる。こんなのは固太りで一見丈夫そうにみえるが一度病気が起ると悪性である。この好例としてある娘が図太りで神奈川で三人の優良健康女学生が表賞された一人であったが浄化が起り終に死亡した。余剰尿は腎部から背中を伝って背部に溜り諸病の原因となる。よく背部張りきって筋肉隆々とみゆる人があるが、これが実は尿毒である。小便を我慢するのは右の如くいけないが頻繁に尿するのも本当ではない。これは腹膜のため膀胱が圧迫され萎宿している処である。 神経痛、頭痛等が天候に左右されるのは、天気の悪い時は太陽の光線が少く霊界に火素が少いから毒が固まり、その圧迫で痛むのである。天候に左右されるのは固まる痛さである。 「問」人の生れ代りにつき、ある霊の申すのに「前生の人の性格中数種の特質（例えは十の特質ありとせはその中の五ないし八種）を具えて生れる場合もある」と申しますが、本当なのでしょうか。この場合に霊の分霊と憑依に就て。 「答」確かに多くなったり少くなったりすることはある。人間の霊には分霊という事はない。神様は高級になる程、いくらでも分霊が出来る。狐などは狐の眷族が方々へ憑るので、丁度分霊のようにみえる。又霊は一瞬にしてどんな遠方でも行くから、分霊された様に思えるのである。 「問」人間が再生した場合、副守護神は前生と同じものがつくでしょうか。又変るとすれば如何なる意味にて変りますか。 「答」死後、副守護神は必す離れ、再生の場合、副守護神は変る。また死後副守護神は暫らく憑いてる場合もあるが、結局は離れる。再生の時、その人に憑く副守護紳は必ず何らかの因縁がある。 副守護神は人間が動物霊になったのや、その土地にいた狐とか狸とか、いくらか因縁のあるものが副守護神になる。生れる子供が霊的階級の低い時は低い霊がつく、それは祖先の罪穢の多少による。罪の多いのは低いとその低さに相当した副霊がつく。 ――――――――――――――――――――――――――― その倫理 岡田氏は「神は、愛であり、叡智である。最大、偉大の愛も叡智である」と信じて居り、信者にも説いている。 また「誠」ということを処生のモットーとし「あらゆる問題を解決する鍵はマコトである」と訓えている。 彼の倫理、信仰について、彼の著書の中から、その片鱗をこゝに抜いてみよう。 （誠） 世界も、国家も、個人も、あらゆる問題を解決する鍵は『誠』の一字である。 政治の貧困は、誠が貧困だからである。物資の不足は、誠が不足しているからである。 道義の頽廃（たいはい）も誠のない為である。秩序の紊乱（びんらん）も、誠のないところに発生する。 あらゆるいま忌わしき問題は、誠の不足が原因である。 宗教も学問も芸術も、中心に誠がなければ、それは形骸でしかない。 嗚呼、誠なるかな、誠なるかな。人類よ、問題解決の鍵は、ただ誠あるのみである。 （正しき信仰） 朱子の言に「疑いは信の初めなり」という事があるが、これは全く至言である。私は「信仰は出来るだけ疑え」と常に言うのである。世間種々の信仰があるが、大抵はインチキ性の多分にあるものか、そうでないまでも下の位の神仏や狐、狸、天狗、龍神等を的としたものが多く、正しい神を的とする信仰はまことに少ないのである。従って、厳密に検討を加えるとき、大抵の宗教は何等かの欠点を包含しているものであるから、入信の場合何よりもまず大いに疑ってみる事である。決して先入観念に捉われてはならない。何程疑って疑り抜いても欠点を見い出だせない信仰であれば、それこそ信ずるほかはないであろう。しかるに、世の中には最初から「信ずれば御利益がある」という宗教があるが、これは大いに誤っている。何となれば、いささかの御利益も認めないうちから信ずるという事は、己を偽らなければならない。故に、最初はただ触れてみる、研究してみるという程度で注意深く観察し、できるだけ疑うのである。そうして、教義も信仰理論も合理的で非の打ちどころがないばかりか、神仏の御加護は歴然として日々奇跡がある程のものであれば、まず立派な宗教として入信すべき価値がある。またこういう宗教もある。それは信者が他の宗教に触れる事を極端に嫌うのであるが、これらも誤っている。何となればそれはその宗教に欠点があるか、または力が薄弱である事を物語っている。最高の宗教であれば、それ以上のものは他にない筈であるから、他の宗教に触れる事を恐れるどころかかえって喜ぶべきで、その結果自己の信ずる宗教の優越牲を認識し、かえって信仰は強まる事になるからである。 しかし、こういう事も注意しなくてはならない。それは相当の御利益や奇跡の顕れる場合である。正しい神仏でも人間と同様上中下あり、力の差別がある。二流以下の神仏でも相当の力を発揮し給うから、御利益や奇跡もある程度顕れるので、大抵の人は有難い神仏と思い込んでしまう。ところが長い間には、二流以下の神仏では往々邪神に負ける事があるから、種々の禍いとなって表れ、苦境に陥る場合があるが、一度信じた以上何等かの理屈をつけ、神仏の力の不足など発見できないばかりか、かえって神仏のお試しまたは罪穢の払拭と解するのである。 信仰者にして病気災難等の禍いがあり一時は苦しむが、それが済んだ後は、その禍い以前よりも良い状態になるのが上位の神仏の証拠である。すなわち、病気災難が済んだ後は、罪穢がそれだけ軽減する結果霊的に向上したからである。それに引き換え、禍いが非常に深刻であったり、長期間であったり、絶望状態に陥ったりするのは、その神仏の力が不足のため邪神に敗北したからである。 世間よくあらゆる犠牲を払い、熱烈なる信仰を捧げて祈願するに関わらず、思うような御利益のないのは、その人の願い事が神仏の力に余るからで、神仏の方で御利益を与えたくも与えられ得ないという訳である。このような場合、これ程一生懸命にお願いしてもお聞き届けがないのは、自分はもはや神仏に見放されたのではないかと悲観し、この世に神も仏もあるものかと思い信仰を捨てたり、自暴自棄に陥ったりして、ますます悲運に陥るという例はよくみるところである。こういう信仰に限って、断食をしたり、お百度詣りをしたり、茶断ち塩断ち等をするが、これらは甚だ間違っている。個人的にどんな難行苦行を行なったとしても、それが社会人類にいささかの稗益するところがなければ、徒労に過ぎないわけで、こういう方法を喜ぶ神仏があるとすれば、もちろん二流以下の神仏かまたは狐狸天狗のたぐいである。故に正しい神仏であれば、人間が社会人類の福祉を増進すべき事に努力し、その効果をあげ得た場合、その功績に対する褒賞として御利益を下し給うのである。ついでに注意するが、昔からよく「いわし鰯の頭も信心から」という事があるが、これは大変な間違いであって、すべて信仰の的は最高級の神仏でなければならない。何となれば、高級の神仏ほど正しき目的の祈願でなくては御利益を与えてくださらないと共に、人間が仰ぎ拝む事によって清浄なる霊光を受けるから、漸次罪穢は払拭されるのである。鰯の頭や低級なる的にむかっていかに仰ぎ拝むとも、低級霊から受けるものは邪気に過ぎないから、心はけがれ、自然不善を行なう人間になりやすいのである。それらを知らない世間一般の人は、神仏でさえあれば、皆一様に有難いもの、願い事は叶えてくださるものと思うが、それも無理はない。もっとも昔から神仏の高下正邪等見分け得るような教育は何人も受けていないからである。そうして、狐、狸、天狗、龍神等にも階級があり、力の強弱もあり、正邪もあるが、頭目になると驚くべき力を発揮し、大きな御利益をくれる事もあるから、信者も熱心な信仰を続けるが、多くは一時的御利益で、ついには御利益と禍いとが交互にくるというような事になり、永遠の栄は得られないのである。 （常 識） 真の信仰とは言語行動が常識にはずれない事を主眼としなければならない。世間よくある神憑式や、奇怪な言説、奇矯なる行動等を標榜する信仰はまず警戒を要すべきである。ところが多くの人はそういう信仰をかえって有難く思う傾向があるが、これらは霊的知識の無いため為で無理もないが、心すべきである。又自己の団体以外の人々と親しめないというような独善的信仰も不可である。真の信仰とは、世界人類を救うのが宗教の使命と信じ、自己の集団のみにこだわらず、排他的行動をとらないようにするのが本当である。 私は信仰の究極の目的は、完全なる人間を作る事であるとも思う。もちろん世の中に完全という事は望み得べくもないが、少なくとも完全に一歩一歩近づかんとする修養――これが正しい信仰的態度である。故に信仰に徹すれば徹する程、平々凡々たる普通人のごとくに見えなくてはならない。そうなるのは信仰を咀嚼（そしゃく）し、消化してしまったからである。その人の言動がいかにも常識的であり、万人に好感を与え、何を信仰しているか分からないくらいにならなければ本当ではない。人に接するや柔らかき春風に吹かれるごとくで、謙譲に富み親切であり、他人の幸福と社会福祉の増進を冀（こいねが）うようでなくてはならない。 私は常に言う事であるが、まず自己が幸福者たらんとするには他人を幸福にする事で、それによって与えらるる神の賜（たまもの）が真の幸福である。しかるに自己のみの幸福を欲し、他人を犠牲にするというがごときは、全く逆効果以外の何物でもない事を知るべきである。 （宗教と政治） 政治と宗教とは大いに関係があるにかかわらず、今日まであまり関心を払われなかったのは不思議である。むしろ、宗教が政治に関与するを好まないばかりか、かえって政治から圧迫されて来たというのが、終戦以前までの実状であった。これは古往今来各方面にみらるる現象で、宗教によっては迫害の強い結果、一時は法灯のまさに消えなんとした例も乏しくはなかった。しかしながら、宗教の目的である理想世界を造り、人類の幸福を増進せんとしても、政治が良くなくてはその目的は達し得られない道理である。この意味において、良き政治には良き政治家が必要となって来るが、良き政治家たるには、どうしても宗教心がなくてはならない。今後の時代をして理想社会を実現せんとするには、まず宗教を政治に織り込む事である、と私は思うのである。 政治家の最も陥りやすい欠点は、外国は知らないが、日本においては涜職問題であろう。しかるにこの原因は宗教心のない唯物的政治家だからである――といえよう。何としても、今後は宗教的政治家の輩出こそ我等が要望するところのもので、それによってのみ将来の国運の進展を期待し得らるるであろう。 私は新日本建設にあたって、何よりも政治家に宗教心を培い、宗教政治が行なわれるようにならなければならないと思う。今人々は口を開けば政治の腐敗、選挙の不正、役人の涜職、人民の脱税、教育家の堕落等をあげるが、全くその通りで、この泥沼同様の社会を浄化せんとして、為政者を始めそれぞれの当事者人民大衆が苦慮しており、その防犯手段として法の力のみを頼りにしているが、これは全然根本を逸している。何となれば、犯罪の根拠は人間の内面にある魂そのものであるからである。この魂を浄化する事こそ真に効果ある方法で、それは正しい信仰以外他にない事を私は信ずるのである。 （宗教と芸術） 今日まで宗教と芸術とはあまり縁がないように多くの人に思われて来たが、私はこれは大いに間違っていると思う。人間の情操を高め、生活を豊かにし、人生を楽しく意義あらしむるものは、実に芸術の使命であろう。春の花、秋の紅葉、海山の風景を眺むる時、文芸美術の素養ある人にして、その目を通す時、言い知れぬ楽しさの湧くものである。我等が理想とする地上天国は「芸術の世界」と言っても過言ではない程のもので、よく言う真善美の世界とはそれであって、芸術こそ美の現われである。しかるに今日まで案外閑却されていたのは、いかなる訳であろうか。昔の高僧は絵を描き、彫刻を得意とし、堂宇まで設計するというように、美の方面に対して驚くべき才能を発揮している。その中で最も傑出した宗教芸術家としては彼の聖徳太子であろう。太子の傑作として今も遺（のこ）っている奈良の法隆寺の建築や、その中にある絵画彫刻等を観る時、今から千二百年以前に建造されたものとは、到底想像も出来ない素晴らしさは何人も同感であろう。 しかるに一方、粗衣粗食、禁欲的生活をしながら、教法を弘通した聖者名僧も多く輩出したので、芸術と宗教は甚だ縁遠いもののように思われる事になったものであろう。これらは真善はあっても美がないわけである。 この意味において、私は大いに芸術をこすい鼓吹しようと思っている。 （敗戦の教訓） 日本が敗けたという事は、日本が救われたのである。一時は悲観のドン底に陥り、上下を挙げていまだかつて経験せざる混迷状態に陥った事は、吾々の記憶に新たなるところであるが、実をいうと、それは一時的であって、将来を思う時は悲観するどころではない、大いに楽観すべき事と思うのである。 一切は原因があって結果がある。日本が敗戦したという事は必ずその原因がなくてはならないが、それは余りにもあきらかである。もちろん少数特権者の野望のために、怖るべき罪悪を重ねた事には違いないが、敗戦という結末は、神がこれ以上罪を重ねる事を許さなかったからである。大多数が期待していたところの神風が予想通り吹いたのである。満州を、朝鮮を、台湾、琉球、千島を返還したという事は、他人の所有権を暴力によって奪いとった――それを返還したまでであって、これが神風でなくて何であろう。不正な富が長く専有を許容されるはず筈はない。そんな都合のよい神国が地球上にありうるわけはない。そして日本は敗戦によっていかに清浄化されたであろう。 しかも神は、今後再び罪悪を行なう事を不可能ならしむべく武器までも取り上げ給うた。少数の罪悪張本人達は、気の毒ながら峻厳なる神の審判（さばき）をまぬがれ得べくもなかった。それのみではない。日本の人民も世界の一等国民として自惚れ驕りに耽りつつも、アジアにおける他民族の困苦などは何等介意しなかった。特権者は権力を濫用して人民の自由を束縛し、財閥は限りなき欲望のために政府と結託し、ますます富の増大を計り、申し訳ばかりの慈善事業をもって社会を欺瞞してきた。二大政党はあっても財閥の傀儡にしか過ぎない。無産者は働けども働けども食えない。発言権も民権もなく、ただ機械のごとくその日を送っていたに過ぎなかった。たまたま改革者が出でんとすれば、たちまち牢獄へ投ぜられた。このような状態のもとに特権者等は泰平を謳歌し、歓楽を極め、大邸宅を占有し、数台の自動車をもち、あらゆる栄華に耽り、飢えに哭く者など歯牙にもかけようとしなかった。このような不合理な状態が決して長く続こう筈はない。果たせるかな、時は彼等をして没落という当然なる運命を甘受せざるを得ない事に立ち至らしめ、まことに気の毒の極みである。その当時貧困者を救いたいと思ったと同様に、今日の没落者を救いたいと、私は痛切に思うと共に、彼等に、その最も適切なる方法を知らしめたい、それがすなわち信仰である。 まず、彼等自身が境遇の大変化は当然神の審判による事であるを知るのが、救われる第一歩である。悔い改め、信仰の道に入ってのみ真の安心立命を得る事を知るのである。それによって以前の栄華時代よりも一層の安心と、幸福の生活に入るであろう事を、私は確信するのである。 （悪の追放） 悪とは何ぞや、言うまでもなく自己の利益のために他人を脅かし、苦しめ、社会を毒する行ないをいうのである。人事百般大なり小なり悪による被害者たらざる者は一人もあるまい。たとえてみれば、盗賊を防ぐために厳重なる戸締りをなし、うまい話を持ちこんでくれば詐欺ではないかと警戒し、何事も疑いの眼をもってみなければならず、近所においての強窃盗の噂、新聞の記事等を見ては、夜も枕を高くして寝るあたわず、汽車電車に乗ればスリに注意せねばならず、商店なれば万引の警戒に眼を放せない。数えあげればほとんどずるい奴に取り囲まれているようなもので、到底安心して生活出来得ないのが社会の現状である。警察裁判所等の防犯機関に要する国費の少なからざること、工場における原料窃取の警戒、製品の蔵出しの際や、金銭の払出等に対する不正の防止、また資本家の度を超えたる利潤獲得等々も、悪が原因になっていないものはないのである。 学校に入学するにも、金銭の高によって成功不成功があるやに聞いている。官庁の許可も、裏面工作をしなければいつになってもおりてこないとの話である。世をあげて闇、ヤミ、暗によらなければ生存さえ不可能と思うほどの実情は、誰も知るところであろう。 このようにみてくると、悪のための被害や損害、不安等、数えあげれば、個人及び社会が蒙る損失は、いかに莫大であるか、計算はできないほどであろう。故に文化の進歩も、新日本の建設も、悪の多寡によって決定さるべきことはもちろんである。ここにおいて私は思う。あらゆる問題も、成功不成功も善悪の量によることで、この意味において為政者も、教育者も、知識人も、世をあげて悪を減滅することに専念すべきで、それ以外に良法のないことを、私は断言して憚らないのである。しからば、その良法とは何ぞや。言うまでもなく正しき信仰である。 （善を楽しむ） つくづく世の中を観ると、情ないかな、どうも悪の楽しみのほうがズッと多いようである。いな楽しみは悪でなくてはならないように思っている人も少なくないらしい。 まず一家の主人公であるが、生活に余裕ができると花柳（かりゅう）の巷（ちまた）へ行きたがり、二号などを囲いたがる。しかも、それがための金銭は正当でない手段によって得るほうが多い。それがため、危ない橋を渡り、国家社会に損失を与えたり、自分自身としても家庭の円満を欠き、不安な生活を送ることになろう。しかも、成功と享楽が人生最後の目的であるかのごとくし思惟（しい）し、しらずしらずのうちに現世的地獄に転落するのであって、そういう人士は中流以上に多いことであると共に、それら成功者を見る大衆は、外面の様相のみに眩惑され、人生これなるかなと羨望しそのまねをしたがるから、いつになっても良い社会とはならないのである。また正直者は馬鹿をみるという言葉もあり、まじめに世渡りをしている者は下積みになり、危ない綱渡りをする者が出世をして、豪奢な生活をするという現状である。 ここにおいて、私は善を楽しむことを教えたいのである。すなわち、相当社会に頭角を顕すようになっても、柳暗花明（りゅうあんかめい）の巷に出入りすることはできるだけ避け、余財あれば社会公共のために費し、困窮者を助け善徳を施し、神仏に帰依し、ときどきは家族を引きつれ映画、演劇、旅行等を娯しむのである。こういうようなやり方であれば、一家は団欒し、妻は夫を尊敬し感謝するようになり、子女のごときも、まず不良になる心配はないであろう。従って、経済不安もなく、不摂生もなく、健康にも恵まれ、長寿も保ち得らるる訳で、日々を楽しみ、心は常に洋々たるものがある。明治の富豪として有名な大倉喜八郎氏はおもしろい事を言った。「人間長生きをしたければ借金をしないことである」と、それは借金ほど精神的苦痛はないからである。私も二十年間借金で苦しんだ経験があるので、よく判る気がする。しかるに現代人の中には、暴露すれば法にふれたり、涜職罪になったりするような事をなし、暗闇の取引を好み、妻君に知れたら大騷動が起こるような秘密を作り、高利の借金をし常に戦々兢々として不安の日を送っており、その苦痛を酒によって紛らそうとする。酒が何程高くなっても売れるのは、そういう訳もあろう。したがって健康を害し、短命となるのは言うまでもないと共に、こういう泥沼生活にはいったものは、なかなか抜け出ることができないのが通例である。まず抜けでる唯一の方法としては宗教に入る事である。 （信仰の醍醐味） 私は信仰の味について世人に告げたいのである。天下何物にも味のないものはない。物質にも、人間にも、生活にも、味の無い物はほとんどあるまい。人生からこの味を除いたら、文字通り無味乾燥全く生の意欲は無くなるであろう。従って人間が生に対する執着の根本は、味による楽しみのためであるといっても過言ではあるまい。信仰にも味のある信仰と味の無い信仰とがあるのは当然である。ところが世の中は不思議なもので、恐怖信仰というのがある。それは神仏を畏怖し、戒律に縛られ、窮屈極まる日を送り、自由などは全く無く、常に戦々兢々たる有様で、こういう状態を私は信仰地獄というのである。 本来信仰の理想とするところは常に安心の境地にあり、生活を楽しみ、歓喜に浸るというのでなけれぱならない。花鳥風月も、百鳥の声も、山水の美も、みな神が自分を慰めて下さるものであるように思われ、衣食住も深き恵みと感謝され、人間はもとより鳥獣虫魚草木の末に到るまで親しみを感ずるようになる。これが法悦の境地であって何事も人事を尽して後は神仏に御任せするという心境にならなければならないのである。 私は常に、どうしても判断がつかぬ難問題に逢着（ほうちゃく）した時、観音様に御任せするという事にして、後は時を待つのである。ところが想ったよりも良い結果を得らるる事は幾多の体検によって明かである。ほとんど心配したような結果になった事は一度も無いといってもよい。また種々の希望を描くが、その希望よりも必ず以上の結果になるからおもしろい。こういう事もある。何か悪い事があるとそれを一時は心配するが、きっと良い事の前提に違いないと思い、神様に御委せしていると、必ず良い事のための悪い事であった事が判り、心配したのが馬鹿らしくなる事さえ往々あるので、実に感謝に堪えない事がある。要するに私は奇蹟の生活者と思っている。私が言う信仰の醍醐味とはすなわちこの様な次第である。 （奇 蹟） 宗教に奇蹟は付き物である。いな付き物であらねばならない。観音教団には奇蹟が非常に多い事は信徒諸士の常に体験するところであろう。奇蹟によって信仰が深くなり、熱が加わる事もまた明らかである。しかるに近代の宗教は奇蹟がすくないため、かえって奇蹟の多い宗教に対し迷信呼ばわりをする傾きのあるのは遺憾であるが、もちろんそれらは唯物主義者であるから止むを得まい。一体奇蹟とは何ぞや、言うまでもなくあり得べからざる事実があり得る事である。例えば幾人もの医者に見放されたる重患者が信仰によって全治する事がよくある。また交通機関等の事故によって危き所を助かったり、負傷すべき筈なのに何等の被害も受けなかったり、特に戦時中外地における出征者や、内地における被空襲等の危機を免れた人々の余りにも多い事である。 宗教的奇蹟を迷信視するジャーナリストにも困ったものであるが、無理のない点もある。成程世間には低劣極まる宗教や、神憑的怪しげな信仰も相当あるにはあり、社会に及ぼす害毒もすくなくないので、これらの弊害を防止すべく迷信を警告するに対しては吾等も賛意を惜まないが、ただ玉石混淆的に、新興宗教でさえあれば一応は迷信視するという態度は感心出来ないのである。科学のメスによっての検討もせず、論理的に研究する事もなく、独断的に否定し去るという事は、文明に背反する態度ではあるまいか。正しい信仰は事実において人類社会の福祉を増進する大いなる役目を果しつつある事を認識されると共に反省を促したいのである。もし奇蹟が迷信であるとすれば彼のキリスト教も迷信という事になろう。何となればキリストが水を葡萄酒に化し、数十人分の量がたちどころに甕に満ちたという事や、盲の眼が開き、跛行者の足が立ったりする等の話は立派な奇蹟である。 私は思う。悠久極りなきこの地球上において、いついかなる時代に奇蹟の宗教が表われないと、誰か言い得るであろう。 （プラグマチズム） 私は若い頃哲学が好きであった。そうして、諸々の学説のうち、最も心を引かれたのは彼の有名な米国の哲学者ウィリアム・ジェームズのプラグマチズムである。まず日本語に訳せば哲学行為主義とでもいうのであろう。それはジェームズによれば、ただ哲学の理論を説くだけであっては一種の遊戯でしかない。よろしく哲学を行為に表わすべきで、それによって価値があるというのである。全く現実的で米国の哲学者らしいところがおもしろいと思う。私はこれに共鳴して、その当時哲学を私の仕事や日常生活の上にまで織り込むべく努めたものであった。そのためプラグマチズムの恩恵を受けた事は鮮少ではなかった。 私はその後宗教を信ずるに至って、この哲学行為主義をして宗教にまで及ぼさなくてはならないと思うようになった。すなわち宗教行為主義である。宗教をすべてに採り入れる事によっていかに大なる恩恵を受けるかを想像する結果として、こういう事が考えられる。まず政治家であれば第一不正を行なわない、利己のない真に民衆のための政治を行なうから、民衆から信頼をうけ、政治の運営は滑らかに行く。実業家にあっては、誠意をもって事業経営に当たるから信用が厚く、愛をもって部下に接するから部下は忠実に仕事をするため堅実な発展を遂げる。教育家は確固たる信念をもって教育に当たるから生徒から尊敬を受け、感化力が大きい。官吏や会社員は信仰心がある以上立派な成績があがり、地位は向上する。芸術家はその作品に高い香りと霊感的力を発揮し、世人によき感化を与える。芸能家は信仰が中心にあるから品位あり、観客は高い情操を養い、良き感化を受ける、といっても固苦しい教科書的ではない。私のいうのは大いに笑わせ、大いに愉快にし、興味満点でなくてはならない。その他いかなる職業や境遇にある人といえども、宗教を行為に表わす事によってその人の運命を良くし、社会に貢献するところ大であるかは想像に難からない。ここで私は注意したい事がある。それは宗教行為主義を実行の場合、味噌の味噌臭きはいけないと同様に、宗教信者の宗教臭きは顰蹙に価する。特に熱心な信者にしてしかりである。世間よく信仰を鼻の先へブラ下げているような人がある。これを第三者から見る時、一種の不快を感ずるものであるから、理想的にいえば、いささかの宗教臭さもなく普通人と少しも変わらない。ただその言行が実に立派で、親切で、人に好感を与えるというようでなければならない。一口に言えば、アク抜けのした信仰でありたい、泥臭い信仰ではいけない。世間ある種の信者などは、熱心のあまり精神病者かと疑わるる程の者さえあるが、この種の信者に限って極端に主観的で家庭を暗くし、隣人の迷惑など一向意に介しないという訳で、世人からその宗教を疑わるる結果となるが、これらは指導者に責任があり、大いに注意すべきであると思う。（以上「信仰雑話」より） メシヤ教の教義 ――薬毒論について―― 岩崎 栄 宗教について、神に就いて――全然無智な唯物論理一点張りのインテリ大衆は、すペての宗教を迷信視する傾向がある。 彼らはまた、常識的に、或いは科学的に、割り切れないもの、不合理なものを「迷信」と罵りすてる傾向をもつ。 常人の頭で割り切れず、その能力では合理性妥当性が発見されないもの――所謂、神秘なるもの、高遠偉大なるものこそが「神」であり、地上何億万の迷える羊を、この「神」に導き入れるものこそが宗教なのであるが、現実的唯物主義者たちにはそれがわからない。まことに困ったものである。縁無き衆生、済度し難き輩である。 彼らによれは、釈迦の涅槃も、キリストの処女誕生も、すべては宗教的金儲け屋の大山カンのデタラメということになるのだ。 アメリカで、イギリスで、フランスで、ドイツで、その他海外のあらゆる文化国で、その国の大学者、聖哲、大政治家、大教育家、等、等が、皆極めて謙虚熱誠なキリスト教の篤信者である現実を、日本のインテリ階級はどう考えているのか！ 神を信じることの篤い英、米、仏などと、宗教を迷信なりと罵倒し去る諸君の日本国とが戦争して、果してどんな結果をみたか、また、どちらの将兵が、占領地の民衆に対して、より人間的であったか――近い経験を反復三省してみるがよかろう。 迷信と正信の区別すら識別する能力をもたぬ、所謂智識階級諸子のために、一応その区別をハッキリきせて置こう。 不道徳なことを教義に持つ宗教は迷信であり、淫教であり邪教である。 人間に、倫理道徳を供給する水源地の如きもの、即ちそうした神聖の神を信仰する宗教が正信であり正教であるのだ。 奇人を行い、現世利益を押し貸りして巨額の金を集める宗教はインチキ宗教であり、宗教的企業である。ゆるすべからざる智能犯的詐欺だというが、ほんとの宗教に、奇蹟は附き物である。人間の限りある智能をもって憶測することの出来ない超常識的な現象が起り、行われる。それが神の力であり、宗教の宗教たるゆえんである。 悩める精神と肉体、濁れる社会と国家。これを、一心不乱の信仰によって浄化し、健全にして貰うこと、それが宗教の本来であり、信仰の理由でもあるのだ。人間の力でどうにもならぬことが実現される。それが奇蹟なのだ。その奇蹟によって・失われた幸福を呼び戻すこと、天国を地上に見出すこと、それが現世利益なのだ。それかどうしていけないのだ、なぜ怪しからンのか？ 釈迦もキリストも、その使徒たちも皆、多くの奇蹟を行って、多くの善男善女を随喜させている。 それはよろしい。それは認めるが、しかし今日の宗教家が、これを行い、今日の善男善女がこれに随喜するのは、インチキだ、迷信だとは、どうした理論の昏迷なのだ？ 現代日本の新興宗教は、巨万の財を集めるから不都合だという人が多い。 いかにも、メシヤ教の如き、何千万か何億かの金が集まったことだろう。だが、これは当然のことだ。三十万人もの信者が居れば、一年に一人が百円献納しても三千万円の巨額となる。御利益をうけたものの嬉しさは、自ら進んで何千円もの献納をするだろう。金を持っている信者は、何万円、何十万円の喜捨をもしよう。それが当然なのだ。信者から献納の無い宗教団体なんて、古往今来ありはしない。もしありとすれは、そんなのは、決して隆盛な宗教ではないのだ。 信者が多く、献納金も多いほどがいいとしなくてはなるまい。問題になるのは、金額の多少ではない。その巨大な浄財の費いかたにあるのだ。その金を持って、教祖や幹部のものたちが、罪悪に類する生活の資に充てる場合。それは絶対にいけないことである。 その金を持って、不倫、不徳義、不経済の生活を営む場合、これは断乎として庸懲せざるべからざる邪教であり、インチキ宗教である。そンな怪しからぬ宗教家も少なくはなかろう。しかし、立派な宗団では、そうした浄財をば、必ずそれぞれ適当な建造物や社会事業などに注入している。キリスト教各種団体の、あの盛んな学校経営。病院の経営。その他文化的施設に、およそどのくらい、純真な信徒の献金が活用されているかを見るがいゝ。 日本の仏教にしてもそうである。インチキ営利宗教の代表的なものと、インテリ諸公が目のかたきにするメシヤ教の如き。熱海と箱根にどのような抱負をもった経綸を行うているか。教祖岡田茂吉氏の所謂「地上天国の実現」が、いかなる計画と規模のものであるか、一度でも行ッてみての罵倒であるのか。一度でも直接聞いてみての、その上での排撃なのか？ メシヤ教は病気に対し、医薬的治療よりも、信仰的浄化治療の方を重しと説いている。 農耕に当って、科学肥料、人糞汚物肥料、その他一さいの人造的施肥を排せよと力説している。 これはとんでもない非常識、迷妄、不道徳罪悪だと罵る声が高い。 昔キリストは「われの来れるは、子をして親に背かしめんがためなり」と言った。一般常識からは、とんでもない反逆であるが、吾々はこのイエスの言葉に心を打たれ、感激を深くする。キリストは決して親不孝と、非人道を強要しているのではない。より偉大な孝行、より崇高な道徳のために、無智無慙な親のエゴイズムに反抗せよと訓えているのだ。 ちょっと浅く考えた場合、おそるべき間違いであるかの感を抱かせるメシヤ教の、医薬問題にしても、また人造肥料排除の自然農法問題にしても、実際に即して、詳しくその真相真理を究めてみれば、いかにも当然と、深く首肯させられるものがそこにある。 「メシヤ教のいう通りに、一さいの医薬治療をやめ、専ら御浄霊によっているうちに、可愛い子供が死んでしまった。だからメシヤ教はインチキなのだ。怪しからん」 そうした誹誘をよく耳にする。新聞などで、鬼の首でも取ったようにそうした噂を書きたてゝいる。 だが、そうした考え方をしている人々は、それは、人間が必ず死ぬるものであるという、極めて簡単な、そうして厳粛な事実を考慮に入れていないのだろう。 それにしても、医薬をなるべく遠離せよ農法は自然に即して、人工的肥料を排すべしというメシヤ教の教義はすいぶん奇矯千万だ、無茶なことだ、という者が多い。しかし、釈迦もキリストも、医薬にたよるなかれ、たゞ神、仏を信頼せよと教えている。 薬師如来といえば、薬屋と医師の元祖みたいに思う人もあろう。中国では、この如来の像に、薬壷を持たせるアイデイヤを思いついた人があった。これは梵語の名称を漢字に音訳したゝめ「薬師」となったまでゞ、当の薬師如来は「諸根不具、聾盲跛躄、白痴顛狂、乃至種々の身病あるもの、わが名を聞けば、皆諸根具足し、身分成満ちることを得さしめん。諸患逼切して、獲なく、依なく、一切の資生医薬を遠離するもの、わが名を聞かば衆愚悉く除かん」と言つて居る。薬師如来とは、大日如来、釈迦などゝ同体である。 釈迦存生の時代、印度には、ちゃんと医薬の業は行われていたしこエジプトにも、ユダヤにも、医薬の道は、キリスト以前数百年から既に開けていたのである。 メシヤ教はしかし、医薬治療を絶対に排撃はしない。医者にかゝってはいけない、薬を服用してはいけない、と厳禁するのではない。たゞ服薬にしろ、注射にしろ、その薬毒の害というものを非常に大きく評価するのだ。 事実、薬毒の服作用がいかに怖るべきものであるかは、医者、その他の科学者ですら明確にこれを認めて居る。 日本人の医科学者で、公然とこの薬毒の弊害を主張している人々も少くはないが、世界的に見ても、人体に薬剤を注入することによって生ずる害毒を認め、その排撃を主張している人々は決してすくなくはない。 メシヤ教刊行物の中に、次のような調査記事が載っている。 ニューヨーク医学専門学校教授アロンザ・クランク氏は「あらゆる薬剤は、すべて毒性を有するものだから、服めはのむだけ患者の活力を減殺する」 また同校教授ジヨセフ・Ｍ・スミス氏も「たいていの薬剤が血液中に混入すると、その薬毒は、まるで毒を服用したのと同様の結果を来たし、血球の活力をマイナスする」 同じ教授のアレキサンダー・Ｈ・スティプンス氏は「開業早々の若い医者は、一つの病気に対しても、実に二十種類もの新薬を常備し、大いに張り切って首途するものであるが、これが三十年くらいもの間を営業しつゞけているうちには、二十種類もの病気に対し、どれにも同じ、たゞ一種の薬だけを投じて平気でいるようになるものだ。およそ臨床経験の深い医者ほど、薬の効顕という迷信から醒めて行くもので、ついには自然の生命力というものに信頼を傾けるようになるものだ」 フランスのルネ・アランデイ博士は「天然痘の予防として、一般に種痘が普及し、これが強制的に行われるようになって以来、奇妙に、結核が旺盛を示して来たことは、疑いのない現実である」 すでにイタリヤでは、ウインナー医学協会々報に「千人中十四人分の児童が、種痘のため腺病質に変った」といってその実例を発表している。 ボルドーの医師ピエロン氏も「成人が結核に犯され易いのは、幼時種痘のためである」 オランダのドクトル・ストレトマケンル氏がかつて労働大臣当時、種痘の施術を全国的に中止すべきだということを、会議に提案したことがある。この会議は一九二七年、オランダのヘーグで開かれたのであったが、その席上、ホフマン博士は、児童が、種痘のためにおそろしい神経系統の疾患を発した実例百十八件を羅列した。 英国政府でも、同じ問題を各地の委員会に諮問した結果、ついに嗜眠性脳炎が種痘を原因とするものであると確認されたことがあった。 アメリカのチャールス・タイアーレル教授は「薬剤は病気を治さない。それは自然の治癒機能を補助しないのみならす、却ってそれを遅滞させる」 アメリカのアラバマ州で名医と謳われるエームズ博士「肺炎の治療に普通の薬物を用いた場合、患者は苦痛を訴え、突然衰弱を示し、或は余病を併発し、快方に赴きつゝあるかの徴侯を見せながら不意に死んでしまうような場合が多かった」 エール大学医料教授ウイリアム・チューザイ博士「かつてコネチカット河附近の部落にチブス性肺灸が洗行し、行者にかゝった患者が悉く死亡した。そこで村民どもは、医者が病気を悪化させるのだといゝ出し、州の法律に反し、断然医療をうけずなると、不思議に、患者は悉く全治した」 いくらウイリアム博士でも、この最後の一句など、われら普通人の常識としては、いさゝかどうかと思われもするのだが、しかしこれは、同大学で博士が講議した、その筆記が、ちゃんと記録されている。 ところで、メシヤ教では、こうした極端なととを言って、医薬を絶対に拒否すべしとは教えていない。たゞ、薬の副作用のおそるべきことを注意する一方、浄霊することによって、自然の快復を助長せよと力説するのである。 岡田教祖は「人間というものは万物の霊長というくらいのもので、霊が主で肉体、物貿は従――つまり霊主、体従のものである。すべての病気は、生活の迷い、不潔、不徳から起る。故に、浄霊をもって、そうしたもろもろの悪を駆除するならは、本来病気というものは、自然に治癒するものである。発熱も、化膿も、疼痛も、一さいの病苦患悩は、自然が病気を治しつ、あるところの現われである」と説いて居る。また、 「私は紙に文字を書くことに心血を傾けている。それは多くの信徒から乞われるままに、出来る限りその満足を与えたいための努力である。ところが信徒たちはそれをお守りとして肌身につける。そしてこの信徒たちは、病気に罹っている患者があると、これに向い数尺離れた位置で、わが掌を翳しながら霊の放射を行うのだ。病苦はこれで殆ど例外なく軽減する。難病とあって医者から見放なされた頻死の人が、私の信徒のこの浄霊法によって全治し再び旺盛な生前を営むようになる。こうした例は、日々無数にあげられている。 起死回生、不可能とし、人間の生命を延長させる。世間はこれを奇々怪々の問題として騒ぎたてるが、このようにして救われた人々の感謝は、日々私の身辺に山積するほどである。 お守を懐にして掌を翳す、これ即ち浄霊の法であるが、これによって盗賊を退散させたり、或は不時の災難から免れしめたりした例も枚挙に遑のないほどだ。 特に農業についての奇蹟――いまやまさに枯死せんとする麦畑が、この浄霊により復活したり、虫害が除かれたり、意外の増産を見せられたり、獣医が手を放なした牛馬その他の家畜が蘇ったり、また人間生活において、貧困が救われ、陰惨な家庭が明朗化したりするのである。 私に対して、よくこんなことをいう人々がある。 「あなたのお書になった書を見て居りますと、その文字通りの形が光りとなって無数に分散し、空間に躍動するように見えます」 或いはまた、 「あなたの腹部に、小さなゴムマリ大の、何か耀かしく光った玉が見えます。あなたの掌からも、さかんに光るものが放射しています」 事実、私の体内には、神霊政射能が絶えず注入されている。これは、神が私の身体を使って、神の経綸を世に行い、私をして地上天国を現出せしめんとしているからだ。 私の体内に宿った「光の玉」というものは、霊線によって無数の光素を放射する。つまり神から授けられた神霊放射能が、更に私から霊線を通じて放射されるわけだ。その光素は、光の極微粒分子で、これが強力な殺菌力をもって、あらゆる病菌、その他の害毒すべてを駆除減滅させるのである」 この岡田教組の言う――また信者たちも言うところ――の光の玉とは、これは仏典の所謂「如意宝珠」のことだと思う。真言の密教には「如意宝珠法」と称する修法がある。 具象的に言えは、岡田教祖の肉体に宿っている宝珠、これはメシヤの神の如意宝珠に繋がって居り、またお守を持って居る何十万の信者にもつながるということなのだろう。 自然農法について 岡田教組が、世界で最初に言いだしたところの人造肥料排斥、自然農法の主張も、決して奇矯なことではない。世界的にも、いろんな人々によって、これが唱えられて来たし、また実行に移している人々も多いのだ。 たとえば、アメリカのペンシルヴァニアで大きな農場を経営している、ローデルという人は、 「世界の人類、家畜ともに、現在では甚しく不健康且つ短命になって居る。それは化学肥料による食物、飼料を食うからだ。濃厚飼料の助けと、種の淘汰によって、乳牛は多量の乳を産出するようにはなったが、しかしその牛は、ほんとの乳牛でなく、その乳もまたほんとうの牛乳ではない。私は、私の農場で、絶対に化学肥料や化学薬剤を用いない。だから、人間も家畜も、絶対に、化学肥料、薬剤を用いた作物を食っていないし、他からも絶対に、そうした食料を買い入れないのだ。わが農場で働く人間と、こゝに飼われている家畜との食料飼料は、すべて絶対に、「生きた土」だけで栽培したものに限られているのだ」と主張し公言している。また更に、氏は言う。 「病気と薬剤とか相互に競争して居る。新薬が創製されると、直ちにまた新しい病気が産れ出る。こういう現象は昔には無かった。古老に聞くまでもなく、昔にはヴィタミン剤などゝいうものは無かつた。カルシュームだつて、鉄分だって、沃度だって『薬剤』から摂ッたのではなかった。その必要が無かったのだ。人間はなぜ、薬を心要とするようなことになったか、それは農業が堕落したせいである。しかも、農家は、人類に悲劇をもたらしつゝあるところの化学肥料農業を営むために、経済的に夥しい労苦と損失を重ねているのだ。 私の農場では、堆肥以外のものは一さい用いない。すべてが堆肥、堆肥万能でやって居る。作物のあらやる穀、木ノ葉、雑草、海草、台所の野菜粕、そうしたもの、すべてを堆肥として積み上げるのだが、中でも木の葉が最もよろしい。木の葉というものは絶大な養分を含んで居る。そもそも、木の根は、十尺、二十尺と地底深く喰い込んで所謂芯土に達して居り、そこから燐酸、加里の如き無機物を吸いあげて葉に送っているのだ。この恵みをうけている葉が、やがて腐蝕質となり、畑の表土を肥やしてくれるのだ。 私は木枯に舞い散る落葉をも、堆肥に積むか、これは、二－三カ月間風化させ、その間ときどき水をかけ、掻き廻して置く。木切れや小枝のたぐいも、細かく、破砕して積み込む。 ゴミ層の中には紙があるが、これは困り物だから取り除く。紙には漂白粉その他、化学薬品が含よれて居り、印刷されたものには恐るべきインクの毒がシミ込んでいるからだ。 わがアメリカでは（アメリカのみならず、世界中どこでもそうだろうけれど）人間の健康が年々に衰えて行くことを重大な問題として居る。アメリカでは水道設備が完備し、医学衛生学を進み、社会的保護施設も充分に行われているのだが、それにも拘らず、癌、神経痛、心臓病の如き変質病は驚くほど増加しつゝある。過去四十年間で、心臓病は六〇％増。癌は九〇％増。それから小児麻痺のような病気も年々増加して居り、更に今まで知られなかッた新しい病気が毎年増発している」 一九四四年の調査では、アメリカでは二千二百万人がカゼを引いて居る。毎年一億の病人がウンウン呻って居る。病院の病床は毎日、七十万が塞がって居る。毎日、国民二十人中の一人は病床に居る。毎年平均一人が十日間病気をし、子供は平均七日間病気して居り、老人は平均三十五日間の病気である。全国平均毎日六百万人が病人となって居りそのうちの四二％が変質病患者である。高血圧、心臓病、レオマチス、盲腸炎、胆嚢炎、癌、胃潰瘍、癌瘡、糖尿病、、神経痛、歯痛――医学の進歩に伴って何故にかくも病魔は蔓延し、国民の健康は蝕まれるのか。 その原因は、化学肥料が、穀物の野菜の栄養価値を変えてしまツたからである。 小麦も昔も今も小麦であるが、化学肥料以前の小麦と、以後の、即ち現代の小麦とは全然栄養価値が相違しているのだ。つまり前時代に含ンでいたような栄養剤を、現代のものは欠落しているのだ。 化学肥料による生産は、人間をして日常食料以外に、栄養剤を気にせねはならぬようにさせてしまった。 生きている上の異常を正すのは、化学者ではなく「生物学者でなくてはならぬ。それはアメリカ農務省のワイルダー博士も言っている「生きている土にだけ、人間や家畜に必要な栄蕃素をもつ作物が育ち、化学肥料を施さなくては育たない土地の作物には、この必要な労養素が無い」と。 土壌にはバクテリヤ、放射状菌、カビ、酵母、原生動物、その他の微生物が無数に居る。これら下等な動植物が群って、土壌の生物学的な生活を営んでいるのだ。これら微生物の分布は、地表三、四寸に限られ、そこには彼らの食料となる有機質が豊富に存在する。微生物たちは、自然界の影響に支配されながら、お互いに微妙な均衡を保ちつつ生活している。もしも土壌の状態が、外部から化学肥料などで悪化すると、微生物の生活は破壊され、植物の生育は順調を欠くようになる。また田畑から害虫を除いてくれる野鳥たちも、金肥の利いた土地には寄りつかない。 化学肥料に毒された土地の作物は、人間の活力を減削するのみならす、家畜にも恐ろしい害毒を及ぼしている。アメリカでは多数の牛がパンダ病に冒され、これによる損害が実に五千万ドルにものぼっている。パンダ病は牛の不妊に原因し、人間には波状熱を起させるものである」 と語っている。ローデル氏以外には、アルベート・ホワード氏は、その著「黄金の土」で「金肥、化学薬物を全然施さない、大自然の恵ゆたかな土こそが黄金の土である」「ミヽズは土を柔らげ、そこに空気と太陽光線を導入する役割を果すことにおいて、黄金の土に大きな功献をなすものだが、化学肥料を入れた土地では、彼は生前に堪えず死滅してしまう。バクテリアもまた死滅する」なぞと発表して居る。 一九四〇年三月三十日附、ニューヨークタイムズに、チャックマン博士も「自然農法による作物を常食とする人間は、カタール、カゼ、ハシカなどの病気に罹らない」と論じている。 ロンドンタイムスによるとアイルランドのダプリンにあるセント・コロンビア大学でも、自然農法を講じている」そうである。 その他、アメリカの小説家プロムフィルト氏、それからバルフォー未人なぞの、いずれも自然農法の多収穫と、人畜への好影響を論じたものがあるが、まず割愛するとして、今度はメシヤ教の説く自然農法なるものを紹介しよう。 岡田自観氏（茂吉氏）は、その著「自然農法解説」で、次のように説いている。 ―――――――――――――――――――――――――――― 今日、我国における幾多の問題の中、その主眼とするところは、何と言っても食糧問題であろう。一年の米作六千三百万石と見、人口の方は八千三百万人として、一人年一石八千三百万石は絶対量である、とすれば不足分二千万石は輸入に仰がなければならない。としたらその金額は一石五千五百円とみて、一千億円の巨額に上るのであるから、このための経済のマイナスは大変なものである。しかも農地面積は、これ以上増やす事は至難であってみれば、人口の増加を喰止める以外に手段はない。産児制限も仲々予期のようにはゆかない。 ところがこの難問題も、数年間に至極容易に、解決出来得る方策を吾等はもっている。即ち新農耕法である。これを直ちに実行すれば、日本は到底想像もつかない程の幸運に恵まれるのであるが、故に一大障碍物がある。それは何であるかというとこの新農法は、これまでの農業とは全然反対であるからである。それがためいかにこの原理を説いても、農耕者は容易に受入れようとしないのである。しかしこれは無理かもしれない。何となれば、我農民が先組代々幾百年に渉って、実行しつつあった方法を一朝にして放棄する事は出来ない。しかしそれは、実は大変な間違いで、一生懸命増産しようとするその方法が、実は減産の方法でしかないのである。従ってただ言葉だけでは、急に掌を返すような訳にはゆかない以上、私は理論と共に実地によって解らせようとし、十数年前から、それを行って来たのであるが、漸次予期以上の驚異的成果を挙げ得るようになり、近来非常な勢いを以てこの農法栽培者が激増しつつある現状である。 （土の偉力） 自然農法の原理とは、土の偉力を発揮させる事である。それは今日までの人間は、土の本質を知らなかった。否知らせられなかったのである。その観念が肥料を使用する事となり、いつしか、肥料に頼らなければならないようになってしまった。全く一種の迷信化したのである。何よりも私が最初の頃、いかほど無肥料栽培を説いても、全然耳を傾ける者がなく、一笑に付せられたものである。それが段々報いられて、近年、年毎に自然農耕者が増加し、収穫においても、至るところ驚異的成果を挙げている。しかし今のところいまだ信者の範囲を出でないが、やがては、日本全土に行渡る日も、左程遠くはあるまいとさえ予想さるるのである。右のごとくであるから、本農法宣伝は単的に言えば肥料迷信打破運動と言ってもよかろう。 そうして、人肥金肥は一切用いず、堆肥のみの栽培であるから、その名のごとく自然農耕法というのである。もちろん堆肥の原料である枯葉も枯草も、自然に出来るものであるからであって、これに引換え金肥人肥はもとより、馬糞も鶏糞も、魚粕も木灰等々天から降ったものでも、地から湧いたものでもなく、人間が運んだものである以上、反自然である事は言うまでもない。 そもそも、森羅万象、いかなるものといえども、大自然の恩恵に浴さぬものはない。すなわち火水土の三原素によって生成化育するのである。三原素とは科学的に言えば、火の酸素、水の水素、土の窒素であって、いかなる農作物といえども、この三原素に外れるものはない。神はこのようにして、人間の生命の糧である五穀野菜を過不足なく生産されるよう造ったのであるから、この道理を考えてみればよく分る。神は人間を生まれさせておきながら、その生命を繋ぐだけの食料を与えないはずはない。もしその国が有する人口だけの食糧が穫れないとしたら、それは神が造ったところの、自然の法則にどこか叶わないところがあるからである。としたら、これに気付かない限り、食糧問題の解決など思いもよらないのである。 以上のような、大自然の法則を無視した人間は人為的肥料を唯一のものとして、今日に到ったのであるから、食糧不足に悩むのは、むしろ当然と言うべきである。全く自然の理法に盲目であったための応報としかも言うべきであろう。しかもそれに唯物科学という学理が拍車をかけたので、ついに今日のごとき食糧難時代を来したのである。この意味からいえば現在の農耕法は、進歩どころではなく、事実は退歩したといってもよかろう。従って自然尊重の農耕法こそ真理である以上、いかに不作でも一人一年一石として、我国の人口八千三百万とすれば八千三百万石は必ず生産されるべきである。これは大地を叩く槌は外れてもこの理は外れる訳はないのである。 私が唱える自然農法とは、右の理が根本であって、現在日本の食糧不足による農民の疲弊困憊（こんばい）なども、実行次第で難なく解決出来るのである。この誤りを見そなわれ給う神としては、捨ておけぬという仁慈大愛の御心が、私を通じて自然農法の原理を普（あまね）く天下に知らしめ給うのであるから、一刻も早くこれに眼を醒まし、本農法を採用すべきであって、かくして農民諸君は全く救われるのである。 さきに述べたごとく、火水土の三原素が農作物を生育させる原動力としたら、日当りをよくし、水を充分供給し、浄土に栽培するとすれば、今までにない大きな成果を挙げ得る事は確かである。いつの日かは知らないが、人間は飛んでもない間違いをしでかしてしまった。それが肥料の使用である。全く土というものの本質を知らなかったのである。なるほど肥料をやれば一時は相当の効果はあるが、長く続けるにおいては漸次逆作用が起る。すなわち作物は土の養分を吸うべき本来の性能が衰え、いつしか肥料を養分としなければならないように変質してしまうのである。これを人間の麻薬中毒にたとえれば一番よく判る。人間が最初麻薬を用いるや、一時は快感を覚えたり、頭脳明晰になったりするので、その味が忘れられず、漸次深味に陥る。こうなると麻薬が切れるとボンヤリしたり、激しい苦痛が起ったりするので、何にも出来なくなる。悪いとは知りつつも麻薬から離れる事は出来なくなり、人の物を盗んでまでも麻薬を手に入れようとする。この理を農業に当嵌めてみれば直ぐ判る。全く今日、日本全国の土壌は麻薬中毒、否肥料中毒の重患に罹っているといってもいい。ところが農民は長い間肥料の盲信者となっているから、仲々目が醒めない。たまたま吾々の説を聞いて、自然農法すなわち人為肥料を廃止するや、最初の数ケ月は思わしくないので、これを見た農民はやっぱり今まで通り、肥料をやらなければ駄目だと早合点し、それで廃めてしまうのが往々ある。 ところが、本農法は信仰が土台となっている以上、私のいう事をそのまま何の疑いもなく実行する。それがため自然農法の真価が容易に判るのである。その経路をかいてみるが、まず最初苗代から本田に移した時、しばらくの間は葉色が悪く、茎細く他田よりもまことに見劣りがするので、それを見た付近の農民からは嘲笑され、本人も危惧を感じ、これで果していいのであろうかと、心配の余り神様に祈願したりして気を揉むのである。ところが二、三カ月過ぎた頃から幾分立直りを見せ、花の咲く頃になると、余程よくなるのでやや愁眉（しゅうび）をひらくがいよいよ収穫直前になると、普通あるいはそれ以上の成育振りに、ようやく安堵の胸を撫で下すのである。さていよいよ収穫の段になると、これはまた意外にも数量など、予想よりもズッと多いと共に、品質良好、艶があり、粘着力強く、すこぶる美味であり、大抵は一、二等格か三等以下はほとんどないといってもいい。しかも目方は有肥米よりも五ないし十パーセントくらい重い事で、特に面白いのはコクがあるから焚減（たきべ）りどころか、二、三割くらい焚増しとなり、飯にすると腹持がよく三割減くらいで、いつも通りの腹具合であるから、経済上から言ってもすこぶる有利である。ゆえに日本人全部が我自然農耕米を食すとすれば、三割増という結果になるので、現在程度の産額でも輸入米などの必要はない事になり、国家経済上誠に素晴しい話である。 最初の二、三カ月くらいの間、見劣りがするのは、種子にも田地にも肥毒が残っているためで、時日を経るに従い土も稲も肥毒が段々抜けてゆくので、本来の性能を取戻し、漸次好転するのである。この理は農民にも判らないはずはないと思う。というのは斜〔洒〕水（しゃすい）をしたり、大雨が降ったりする後は不良田も幾分良好になる。これなどは全く肥毒が多過きたのが洗われて減少したためである。農民は少し作物の生育が悪いと客土をし、それでやや良好となるや、農民の解釈は長い間土の養分を作物に吸われ、土は痩せたのだから、新しい土を入れればよくなるというが、これは誤りで実は年々の肥毒により土が衰え痩土となったためである。 そうして自然肥料実施について説明してみると、稲作に対しては稲藁を出来るだけ細かく切り、それをよく土にこね混せる。土を温めるためである。また畑土の方は枯葉や枯草の葉筋が、軟かくなるくらいを限度として腐蝕させ、それを土によく混ぜる。これは土が固まっていると植物は根伸びの場合、尖根（さきね）がつかえて伸びが悪いから、固まらないようにするのである。近来よく言われる根に空気を入れるといいとしているが、これは空気が根にいい訳ではない。ただ空気が根元に入るくらいであれば、土が固まっていないからである。これなども農学者の解釈は誤っている。 ゆえに、理想からいえば浅根の作物は畑土に、草葉の堆肥を混ぜるだけでいいが深根のものは特に畑土一尺くらい下方に木の葉の堆肥の床を作るといい。これは土が温まるからである。ただしその厚さは、深根といっても色々種類があるから、それに応じた厚さにすればいいのである。堆肥の効果は、土を固めないためと、土を温めるためと、今一つは作物の根際に土乾きがする場合、堆肥を相当敷いておくと、湿り気が保つから乾きを防ぎ得るという、以上三つが堆肥の効果である。 以上、自然農法の根本は、土そのものを生かす事である。土を生かすという事は、土壌に人為肥料のごとき不純物を用いず、どこまでも清浄を保つのである。そうすれば土壌は邪魔物がないから、本来の性能を充分発揮し得る。農民は土を休ませるというが、これも間違っている。作物を作れば作る程土は良くなる。人間で言えば働けば働く程健康を増すのと同様で、休ませる程弱るのである。農民作物を連続して作る程養分が吸われるとなし、畑を休ませる。この誤りのため連作を不可とし、毎年場所を変えるがこれなども論外であって、気の毒な程愚かである。本農法においては連作を可とする。現に私が実行している例であるが、今年作った玉蜀黍（とうもろこし）のごときは連作七年に及んでおり、しかも箱根強羅の小石混りの土で、恐らく不良土としては申分がない、にもかかわらず本年の出来栄えなどは素晴しいもので、実付きは行儀よく密集し、棒は普通より長く、甘味があって柔らかく、美味満点である。しからばなぜ連作がよいかというと、土壌は作物の種類によって、その作物に適応すべき性能が自然に出来る。これも人間にたとえればよく判る。労働すれば筋肉が発達し、常に頭脳を使う作家のごときは頭脳が発達する。また人間が年中職業を変えたり、居所を転々すると成功しないのと同様である。 ここで、言いたい事がある。それは無肥料の桑の葉で養蚕すると、蚕は病にかからず、糸質すこぶる強靱で、光沢良く、その上増産確実であるから、これが全国的に実行されるとすれば、蚕糸界に一大革命を起す事はもちろんで、国家経済上いかに大なる利益をもたらすかは、けだし測り知れないものがあろう。 （虫 害） 近来、農村の悩みは、肥料代の高価と虫害と風水害との三つであろう。この虫害についてまず、結論からいうと、害虫は肥料によって湧くと思えばいい。それは肥料によって土壌を汚すため、土壌は変質し、土の性能は退化されると共に不潔物が残存する。あらゆる物質は不潔なるところ必ず腐敗するのは当然で、そこへ小虫が湧き、細菌が発生する。作物も同様である。何よりも肥料溜（こえだめ）に蛆が湧くのでも判る。そうして害虫にも色々の種類があるのは肥料に種類があるからである。近来、新しい害虫が発生するというが、もちろん新しい肥料が出来るからである。農民が肥料溜のある付近は、害虫の発生が多いとよくいうのでも判るであろう。今一つ重要な事は、害虫発生の場合駆除の目的で殺虫剤を撒布するが、これがまた非常に悪い。何となれば、殺虫剤とは虫を殺すくらいの毒薬である以上、これが土に滲透すれば、土はその毒に中（あ）てられ、不良土となるのである。従ってその土へ栽培された植物は、肥毒以外別な毒分まで追加されるので、土はいよいよ弱るので、害虫は得たりかしこしと、繁殖の勢を増す。全く鼬鼠（いたち）ゴッコである。この点においても今日までの農法がいかに誤っていたかが判るであろう。そればかりではない、硫安のごとき化学肥料は劇毒薬であるから、それを吸収した米を食うとすれば、自然人体も影響を受け、健康に悪いのはもちろんである。それは血液が濁るからである。何しろ主食は一日三度ずつ、年が年中食っているとすれば、たとえ僅かずつでも積りつもって相当の毒分となり、これがあらゆる病気の原因となるのである。ここで伝染病の真因を簡単にかいてみるが、そもそも伝染病とは細菌の侵入によって発病するのは誰も知っている。しかしながらなぜ、細菌が侵入すると発病するかの理由は判っていない。また細菌侵入するも発病者と未発病者とが出来る訳も医学ではいまだ解っていないのである。黴菌とは、血液の濁りの原素である微粒子を食物とし、それを食いつつ繁殖するのであるから、菌の食物を有している人は発病するが、無い人は菌は餓死するから発病しないという訳である。右のごとくであるから、発病者と未発病者とが出来るのはもちろん菌の食物の有無によるのである。また保菌者といって菌があっても発病しない人があるが、これは菌の食物が発病する程の量もなく、そうかといって死滅する程少なくもないという言わば中間状態である。とすれば、濁血者は発病し浄血者は発病しない事になるから、化学肥料のごときは、血液を濁す事はなはだしく、近来伝染病や、結核のごとき、細菌による病人が殖えるのもそれが原因である。この説は自画自讃かも知れないが、世界的大発見と言ってもよく、この一事だけでもノーベル賞の価値は充分あると思うが、いかんせんノーベル賞審査員の学問程度が、右の説を理解する程に到っていない以上、致し方ないのである。この理によって自然農法が全般に行われるとしたら、いかに病人が減るかは想像出来るであろう。 （風 水 害） 次に、風水害であるが、その防止に官民共に大いに悩んでいるのは衆知の事実である。防止施設にはすこぶる多額の費用を要する。ところが、我自然農法によれば、作物の根張りがつよく、茎折れなどは現在のそれよりも何分の一に減るばかりか、花落ちも少なく、冠水後の稲の腐敗もないから、他田が相当被害を蒙る時でも、自然農法の田は被害という程の被害は認められない程で、人々はただ不思議がるのである。その際根の先をよく調べて見ると、在来の有肥田のそれより、細根の数が非常に多く長いので、根張りが強靱である。これは人間にたとえれば毒分のない新鮮な食物を常に摂取していると、健康であるのと同様の理である。農耕者はよく作物の背丈が短く、葉が小さいのを可としているが、これは実付きがよく収穫が多いからで、この点本農法がそうである。今までのごとき、有肥によると、葉に栄養分をとられるから葉が延びすぎ、それだけ実に影響を与えるのである。また自然農法によれば、稲の分蘖（ぶんけつ）がすこぶる多く、今日まで最も優良なのは一粒の種で、分蘖百五十、粒数約一万五千という到底信じられない程の、驚異的記録もあった。なお今一つの特長は、稲藁を使用する場合、非常に強く細工が仕良いそうである。 （寄生虫問題） 寄生虫問題は、今日非常に喧（やかま）しく言われている。何しろ蛔虫（かいちゅう）保有者が日本人中、八○パーセント以上というのだから実に重大問題である。蛔虫によって死亡する者も、近来少なくないという事である。普通蛔虫といえば数匹にすぎないが、人によっては数十匹ないし数百匹に上るものさえある。こうなるとちょうどうどん玉のようになっていて、内臓機関へまで食い込んでゆくが、そうなると種々の苦痛が発する。この原因は無論糞尿肥料によって、医学でも唱えるごとく蛔虫の卵が、野菜から人間の口を通じて胃に入り繁殖するのである。ところがその他の蟯虫（ぎょうちゅう）、十二指腸虫、疥癬虫、水虫等々いずれも小虫の繁殖によるのであるが、医学ではいまだ病原不明とされているが、私の研究によれば、実は人為肥料のためで、直接の原因ではないが、人肥によって血液が濁るから小虫が湧くのである。大体、人体に虫が湧くなどとは道理に合わないのである。なるほど、死人ならとにかく、生きている人間に虫が湧くなどとは、不合理もはなはだしいと言わねばならない。それは全く人間が天理に外れているからで、体内へ入れるべからざる不潔なものを入れ、血液を濁すからである。この意味において、人間は新鮮な空気を吸い、清浄な水を飲み、不純物のない土から生じたものを食しかつ薬剤のごとき異物をなるべく用いないようにすれば、無病息災たる事はもちろんで、寿齢も百歳以上は決して不可能ではないのである。 （浄霊の偉効） 自然農法を行う場合、浄霊による効果の顕著なる事は、増収報告の中に必ずある。 自然農法の原理は、従来の人為農法によって土が汚されているため、土は活力を阻害され、本来の性能を発揮出来ないから、成績が悪いという原理を、農民は知らなかったので、今日まで高い肥料を購い、結果が悪く骨折り損の草臥（くたびれ）儲けをして来たのを、私は神示によってその誤りを知り、今までとは反対に土を清浄にする程、作物はよく出来るという原理を発表したのであって、その通り実行したものは素晴しい成績を挙げている事は、本教刊行物に満載されている通りである。それについて浄霊がなぜ農作物に、顕著な効果があるかという事を知りたい人は、沢山あるだろうからここにかくのである。 そもそも、万有は霊と体で成立っている事は、本教信者はよく知っているはずだが、もちろん、土も作物も、霊と体から成立っている以上、土が人為肥料によって汚されていれば、土の霊もその通り曇っている。ところが一度浄霊するや、土の霊の曇りが減るから、その通り土の方も不純物が減り浄まるのである。従って、清浄になった土は成育力が旺盛になると共に、作物の方も残っている肥毒が減るから、両々相まって、霊主体従の法則により、成育が旺盛になるのである。 （素人菜園に就て） 素人栽培、すなわち家庭菜園としても、肥料は糞尿を多く使わなければならないので、馴れない素人が糞尿を扱うとしたら、実に堪えられない苦痛である。そんな苦痛をしても大いに効果があるとすれば我慢もするが、実はそれが反って成績不良の結果となるのだから、恐らくこんな馬鹿な話はあるまい。 自然農法によれば、汚い臭い思いは全然なくなり、清潔で衛生的で、作物の出来がよく、量も多く、その美味なる事驚く程である。しかも害虫の心配もないばかりか、蛔虫の危険もなく、第一葉色にしても、茎の形にしても実に今までの有肥のものより美しい。従って自然農法を始めると、毎朝畠弄（いじ）りが実に楽しくなる。 素人栽培にはこういう事がよくある。それは馬鈴薯（ばれいしょ）など実付きが悪いとか、実が大きくならないとか、トマトや茄子（なす）など、花落ちが多かったり、スのある大根が出来たり、胡瓜（きゅうり）など根虫が湧いて枯れるとか、漬菜（つけな）類など完全な葉はほとんどなく、どの葉も穴だらけである。以上いずれも人為肥料のためであるが、それに気が付かないため、素人は肥料が足りないからだと思い、益々多く肥料を与えるから、益々悪くなるという訳で、誰しも本当の原因が判らないから、専門家に訊くが、専門家も肥料迷信に罹っている以上、満足な解答は与えられないので困っている人が、世の中にはいかに沢山あるか知れない。従ってそれらの人達が本農法を知ったなら、いかに救われるか、全く地獄から天国へ昇ったような気持となるであろう。

――― 岡 田 自 観 師 の 論 文 集 ―― 関連出版物 医学関係御論文集 写真はありません 医学関係御論文集 編集者 不明 発 刊日不明 推定、昭和２９・３０年頃 この『医学関係御論文集』は、光、救世、栄光の各紙と地上天国に掲載された医学関係の御論文249編と『文明の創造』から８編『医学革命の書』から８編の計265編の御論文が収録されています。 この御論文集に収録されている『文明の創造』と『医学革命の書』は『岡田茂吉全集』に収録されているものとは編集が違います。 これはまだ未確認ですが、『文明の創造』のほうは『御教え集』中に「文明の創造の論文」として朗読されたものが収録されているようです。 『医学革命の書』のほうもその傾向はありますが、すべてではないようです。 収 録 御 論 文 無信仰と有信仰 光 2 岡田道一先生に物申す 救世61 アメリカを救う〃結核〃 栄光180 治るんだ 3 バーナードショウ長命の秘訣、菜食主義 栄光78 宗教と病院 181 宗教と医学 6 私と病気 80 健康は一切なり 182 宗教からみた産制問題 7 生野菜 81 注意 182 自然無視の文化 9 浄霊法変る 84 黴菌人間 183 健康による天国化 光号外 誰でも太れる法 86 爆弾を抱いている現代人 184 寸 言 光号外 薬毒 88 医療とは 185 神示の医学「浄霊の原理」 光号外 結核亡国論 91 医学断片集（22）神経とは 185 此事実を何とみる 光 11 子供を健康にするには 95 医学療法と信仰療法 186 産制開庫の別の観方 11 文化の迷蒙 96 医学は科学？ 186 宗教は奇蹟なり 11 免疫と抵抗力 103 善意の罪悪 187 悲劇を滅する 12 宗教なるが故に 104 医学断片集（23）手当 187 栄養の喜劇 13 現代医学論 105 本教信者の幸福 188 天国化と健康問題 14 蓬莱島 106 名人の失くなった理由（１） 190 細菌恐るべき乎 15 毒結五十年 107 医学断片集（24）鉄剤 190 亡国的産制論 16 病気礼讃の弁 112 名人の失（なった理由（２） 191 お蔭話を読んで 16 医者は果して無章任か 114 現代医学を嗤う 191 之を何と見る 17 対症療法の可否 114 医学断片集（25）体質 191 真理の具現 18 黴菌は有難いもの 115 名人の失くなった理由（３） 192 方法論と結果論 19 此事実を考えて見よ 115 医学断片集（26）医師の無責任という言葉 192 坊ちゃんを作る健康法 20 医師の医学迷信 117 風邪引結構 193 寸 評 身体をこわす 20 三大迷信とは何か 119 スポーツマンの早死の理由 193 寝 冷 20 無題（赤痢に関する御論文） 119 医学断片集（27）効果の言葉 193 疫 痢 20 微熱というもの 120 大恐怖時代来らん 194 内臓の三位一体と浄霊 21 現代医学進歩の窮極 121 医学断片集（28） 194 菊五郎丈の死 21 浄霊の発明的価値 123 理窟ならぬ理窟 195 大三災と小三災 22 医学の考え方 123 医学断片集（29）欠伸 195 神霊医学は民主的医学なり 22 結核と馬車馬 124 薬が効かなくなった 196 意外な話 23 御蔭話から何を得る 125 若しもこの世界から悪がなくなったら 197 産制の愚 23 自分で病気を知る法 125 恐るべき農村結核 199 寸評 名医故入沢博士 23 医師は本教の協力者 126 病気が治ればいい 200 ホルモン 23 今の医学 128 児童の歯牙に就いて 200 疥癬の原因 23 医学の革命 129 野蛮なる文明 201 寸 評 徽菌は根絶出来るか 24 BCG問題 130 先駆者の悩み 202 結核新薬に就て 24 食欲と頭脳 135 心臓の手術 203 自家中毒 24 九分九厘と一厘 138 結核信仰療法に就いて 204 寸 評 美人になる法 25 医学と浄霊 142 麻疹なんか何でもない 205 或質屋の話 26 罪の因は薬 142 恐るべき漢方薬 207 眼を洗う 26 手術は野蛮 143 医学断片集（30）逆栄養 207 薬剤亡国論、薬毒怖るべし 26 神霊医学断片集（１）浄霊の急所 145 病人氾濫の布哇 211 軽視出来ない事実 27 体内の入浴 147 近頃の世相 214 日本脳炎は果して蚊の媒介か？ 30 医学断片集（２）闘病という言葉 147 べートーヴェン 214 造物主に反抗する医学 30 医学談片集（３）医学の盲点 148 迷信時代 221 ワクチン禍の実例 31 科学封建 149 超科学 222 寄生虫問題 33 医学断片集（４）神経の所為 149 日本の危機 224 医薬断片集 或る未亡人の話 33 結核新薬を嗤う 150 医学が私の説を採入始めた？ 224 輪 血 33 医学断片集（５）赤痢 150 神と硝子玉 225 正しい治療 33 御蔭話を読んで 151 毒塊人間 226 食はず嫌い 34 医学断片集（６） 151 医学封建 227 医薬談片集 或眼科医の話 34 医療誤点の種々相 152 薬剤に科学性はない 227 或看護婦長の話 34 医学断片集（７）信用ある医師 152 結核患者現在四百万人 227 ヒロポン中毒 36 世界的丁髷時代 155 本教発展の主因 228 おかげ話から何を掴んだか 36 医学断片集（８）薬毒皆無になれば百歳以上生きる 155 分っていて分らない 228 空前の難問題 37 医学断片集（９）便秘の誤解 156 超 愚 229 医学談片集 病は内から外ヘ 37 浄化の言葉 157 詐欺時代 231 人形医学 37 医学断片集（10）体温計 158 三日間で博士が出来る 232 人体は綜合体である 38 癌病に就て 158 寿命が延びた理由 234 科学迷信 38 世界的迷信としての現代医学 159 医学は迷信か 235 煙草と医学 40 医学断片集（11）歯の痛み 159 新聞の売薬広告 236 夜の終り近づけり汝等悔改めよ 42 医学断片集（12）脂肪肥り 160 浄霊医術の実験 239 私の健康法 43 結核半減記念祝いに就て 161 薬が効かなくなった 239 憐むべき現代人 44 現代医学に対する哲学的考察 161 浄霊は科学療法なり（１） 243 低能児は治る 45 医学断片集（13）治療という言葉 161 浄霊は科学療法なり（２） 247 自殺者の無責任 45 赤痢流行に就て 162 薬剤は科学？ 254 結核予防は不可能か、神医学を信ぜよ 46 医学断片集（14）神経という言葉 162 私は宗教科学者だ 255 某医博との対談 47 伝染病恐るるに足らず 164 医学者に警告する 257 今の流行インフルヱンザ 救世48 医学断片集（15）発育の遅れる児童 165 医学に望む 地天 2 冷えるという事 48 薬屋さんには御気の毒 165 神霊放射能時代 4 霊的には無解決「脳外科療法に革命」に就て 49 医学断片集（16）眼にゴミが入る 166 乳幼児の健康 4 医者の遁辞 49 医学断片集（17）頭の病気 167 日本人と精神病 8 輸血 49 医学断片集（18）赤痢菌 168 学理の魔術 10 辛いものを避ける 49 医学断片集（19） 169 医学談片集 変な話 10 抵抗力 50 医学関係者に警告する 171 事実は雄弁なり 11 消化に就て 50 医学の罪悪観 172 結核ナンセンス 12 幼児の食物に就て 51 ○ヽの文化 173 沢村田之助他 13 病気は果して恐しいか 53 悪の追放 173 医学の革命 13 医師が電療に反対する 53 薬毒の恐怖 173 現代医学で病気は治るか 15 麻疹とその手当 55 医学断片集（20）塵芥溜には虫が湧く 173 行者の病気治し 15 病気とは排毒作用 57 医学断片集（21）薬と名の付くものは全部麻薬なり 174 医学の盲点と自然良能力 16 絶対的健康診断 58 菜食のよき例 174 病原と浄霊の原理 26 平均浄化に就て 59 米国に於ける驚くべき病者の氾濫 175 真文明とは何ぞや 27 痔に就て 60 医学断片集 176 薬が不幸を作る 44 薬効短見論 61 アメリカを救う〃病気とは何ぞや〃 179 私という者（一） 47 文明の創造 序 文 御教え集13号 梗 概 御教え集13号 天国建設の順序と悪の追放 〔天国建設と悪の追放〕 御教え集12号 九分九厘と一厘 御教え集13号 病気と寿命〔健康と寿命〕 御教え集13号 種 痘 御教え集 3号 癌の病〔癌？〕 御教え集15号 救い主と贖罪主 御教え集14号 医学革命の書 序 文 御教え集18.23号 医学は迷信なり 御教え集18号 健康の自由主義 御教え集25号 真の医術 未確認 病気と苦痛 未確認 医学迷信 未確認 恐るべき科学迷信 御教え集33号 医学の発見に就て 未確認

――― 関 連 出 版 物 ――― 世に憎まれたメシヤ教 岩崎 栄 『メシヤ教批判』昭和26(1951)年9月25日発行、日本宗教新聞社刊 メシヤ教――旧、観音教――通称、お光り様。教祖岡田茂吉。当年六十八歳。 これこそは終戦後、わが国での、憎まれものの最たるものであったろう。 「怪しからン」というのである。 「インチキ極まる」と罵るのだ。 「やッつけろ！ 叩き潰さにャいかン」と叫ぶのだ。 戦後、わずか数年の間に、片手を振りながら、巨万の富を掻き集めたというのだ。手を振ッて儲ける商買は、株屋もそうだが、これには損、得、――表、裏というものがある。メシヤ教のは掻き集める一方で、決してロスというものが無いのだから、言語同断だという。 片手を振る――これを（御浄霊する）と称し、まことに非科学約な実にコドモだましに類する、たわいもない迷信を流布し、もって、無智無学な衆愚の懐中を絞りあげているというのである。 ぜんたい、どの程度の絞りあげかといえば、「まず、うちわに見て、全国に三十万の信徒ありと仮定し、一カ月、一人平均十円を絞り上げると見て、月額三百万円。その他に何や彼やで、年につもれは、すくなくとも五六千方円という巨額だ」 「何か、お守りみたいなものがあるそうじゃないか、光という字一字書いた」 「それだよ、インチキからくりの根元が。その紙片一枚を千円とか二千円とかで買わなきゃ、信者ということにならンのだ。仮りに千円としても、三十万人だと三億だ」 「あゝ三億！ 凄いね」 「だから征伐しなきゃいけないンだ」 「しかし待てよ、三億は大金だが、だから征伐しなくてはいけないという公式は成り立たないぞ。いくら大金にしてもさ、信者が得心ずくで納めるものならそれでいいじャないか」 「なにをバカな！ 無智にして憐れむべき信者たちは、皆、騙れて持ち込むンだ」 「例のあの手さ、またもあの手で騙されたってね」 「冗談じゃない」 「冗談じゃないよ、まったく。御浄霊と称し手を振って万病を、たちどころに癒し、農作物を増収させ、医薬も、肥料も全然不要だッていうンだ。まるで、文化の反逆なンだ。愚昧と安逸と迷信とへの煽動によっての金儲けなンだ。闇成金の大魔王だ。冗談どころの騒ぎじゃない。すべからく、速かに、文化国家の面目として撲滅せざるべからすだよ」 「へえ！ 大変な野郎なンだね」 「そうだよ。単純な（お有難屋）とか、誇大妾想狂じゃないンだ。おそるべき智能犯なンだ。同じイカサマ宗教にしても君、踊る宗教なンてのは、たあいがなくて、無邪気で、むしろ可愛いがね、お光り氏と来たら、こいつはキミ、計画的宗教企業なンだからね、下町の古道具屋か何か、小商人の伜で、彼自身、若いころには小間物屋をしてたというンだもの。小間物店といえばキミ、ヘドのことだ。そンなところから神さまが産れるものか。バカバカしい」 「だけど、それァキミ、馬小舎の中から、父無し児のキリストが産れたッてためしもあるし、日蓮は漁師の母アが、網納屋で産ンだッていうぜ」 「だけどキミ、キリストや日蓮はだ、すくなくとも、お守り札を売って金儲けしたり、巨万の富を積んで脱税したりはしなかったよ」 以上のような会話は、ここ数年来――今日もなお、サロンで、酒場で、事務室で、乗り物の中で、到るところで、いわゆるインテリ階級といわれる人たちの話題として、頻りにやり取りされている。まッたく、轟々たる世論の目標となっているのだ。 メシヤ教は、その教是として、無医薬治病と無肥料栽培を力説するのだが、これに対する科学者、医薬業者、肥料製産者、及び一般知識階層の非難と反感と憎悪とは、まことに暴風の如くに、強大熾烈を極めている。 検察当局、これがついに、メシヤ教の動静、在り方について、疑惑の眼を光らせるようになった。 敗戦後の軍部は、某々右翼機関（たとえば児玉機関の如きもの）と共謀し、中国の儲備銀行に在った大金魂を、このメシヤ教に売りつけたという流説や、投書によって、検事警察は俄に緊張して来たが、更にメシヤ教はダイヤモンドその他の貴金属、物統令違反の物資を隠匿山積しているということ、それから、邪教に付きもののいかがわしい風紀問題。そうした風説によって一層の刺戟を受けた。 そこへ持って来て、メシヤ教の何千万円の所得税怠納という問題が突発した。 教団の財産であるところの莫大な土地、家屋、それから巨額の収入。そうしたものを宗教法人とせずして、教主岡田茂吉個人名義としていたために、同じく現代日本の知識階級であるところの税務吏が、合法的に課税し得る最大限度税率を、これに賦課して来たものであった。 「ざまア見ろ！ インチキ観音教」 世論は痛快がった。ことここに至れば、もはや、新聞、雑誌――所謂商業ジャアナリズムが黙っている筈はない。 東京の大新聞、Ａ、Ｂ、Ｄ等、等が前後して筆を動かしかけた。脱税問題その他を取りあげ、この教団の内部曝露、異常な膨張発展の裏面検討――そうした方向に筆誅の鉾先を揃えて行った。やがて綜合雑誌、大衆読物誌、婦人雑誌など、絶好の課題に、われのみおくれてなるものか、といった調子で乗り出した。 それらの記者のある者は、これを外面から攻撃した。風評、流説、中傷、讒誣、すべてを綜合し、それに、自分の先入感と、合理的想像を加味した攻勢記者だッた。 またある記者たちは、メシヤ教の幹部に会ったし、二、三の者は直接に、教組岡田氏にインタアビューした。 筆者もまた、サンデー毎日誌及び、毎日グラフ誌の依嘱をうけて熱海に出張した一人であった。 週刊朝日は、話豪徳川夢声君を差し向けたし、某誌からは女流作家吉屋信子女史が出馬した。 それらの中で、最も痛烈を極めたものは、某誌に寄せた大宅壮一君の筆致だったが、果然、インテリ階層の読者は手をたたいて快哉を絶叫した。 比較的同情と理解を持ったかに思える書き方をしたのは吉屋女史で、一番公平無私だったのは、週刊朝日の徳川夢声君であった。 私は徳川君ほどの君子ではないから、他の新聞記者諸氏と同じような、ジャーナリストの探検、征伐慾を、多分に、旺盛に燃やしながら出かけたものだった。それというのが、私という人間が、もと新聞記者だったからである。 熱海に在るインチキ邪宗門的いわゆる新興宗教。そこの教組と称する強かな怪物岡田茂吉、イデ正体見破りくれん、という――それほどでもないが、まずそういったような気構えでもって出征に及んだわけだった。 私は昔の新聞の社会部記者だったが、ありていにいえば、決して上等の記者でなかったことは事実である。まず中等以下だったろう。この中以下の社会部記者の心理というものは、この私の当時の心もちが、一ばん適切にこれを代表していると思う。 先ず、なンでもかでも、世に栄え、はびこり、景気よく旺ンなるもの、これ悉く、本能的に憎悪し、反感し、そうした角度から睨んでかからなくては、虫がおさまらない、といった、性癖の私だった。 どこか、異常な事件は無いものだろうかと、毎日、犬のようにそこいらを嗅ぎ廻っていた。犬、そうだ、同じ犬の事件でも、犬が人に吹みついたのでは面白くない。人が犬に咬みついたというのならは愉快だ。更に、総理大臣か陸軍大将かが、ワン！と吠えて犬に咬みつかないものかなァ！ と、ひそかに念願していた。 椿事、不祥事、喧嘩出入、天災地妖――なンでも騒動や不幸は、大きいほど嬉しく、従ってまた大きからんことを希い願っていた。 美談よりも醜聞を好んだし、他人のことは、生よりも死を珍重とした。 皇室に御慶事や何かがあっても、先ずそのことを利用して新聞が儲かり、読者数が拡張出来るようにと、ひたすらくふうを凝らした。まことにもって不忠無頼の痴れ者だったのだ。 問題を本筋に復えして――しかし、だから私は、熱海のメシヤ教に対しても、相手が極めて奇怪な存在たることを希望し、また予想もしたのであったが、ところが、こと、こころざしに反し、意外にもこれが平凡だったことに唖然とし、かつ失望した。あまりにも平々凡々過ぎるのであった。 なアンだ。これじャ、こっちの商買にならんではないかと思った。外面的に何らの構えがあるでなく、内部的にまた、なんの勿体ぶった設備もしてなく、シタタカな怪物という御当人の岡田教祖というのが、これがまた、つい、そこいらで、ざらに見かけるおタナの御隠居然たる人態なのだ。 この人と対談してみたが、別に何も、神懸ったことを言うでもなく、気取ッた態度を示すわけでもなかった。つまり、全然、舞台装置のない舞台で、全然芝居っ気のない言葉で、医薬療法の科学的に幼稚なことを語り、自然農法を説き、文化や、政治を論じ、小説や絵画や映画、演劇について、滔々と蘊蓄を傾けるだけなのだ。しかもこれが、下町調の江戸ッ児弁である。 だから、ありていに言えば、私は内心、これは記事にならないと、ガッカリしたわけである。でも、しかたがない、私は書いた。一問一答をそのままに書いた。眼に見た現実はそのままに描写した。同行の写真氏には、あるがままの現象を撮影して貰った。 そしてこれが毎日グラフとサンデー毎日とに発表されたのであった。ところが……… これを編集し発表した毎日グラフの責任者が、同じ社内の同僚から、とンでもない中傷非難の声を浴びせられたということを聞いて、私は、驚きはしなかったが、ああ、そういうことがあるのかなアと、淋しい気持にならされた。それは、その中傷非難というのは、当該編集責任者が、観音教から多額の金を貰って、同教の宣伝をしたといい出されたのだそうである。 私がかつて新聞記者であった時代にも、社内にそうしたことを頻りに流布して歩く小姑的人物が多くいたが、トンデモ・ハップン型のアプレ記者にも、やはりその亜流があとを絶たずにいるものと見える。 再び問題を本筋に戻すが、とかくメシヤ教は呪いの的である。憎まれ人気の覇者たるの観がある。まさに話題の王者といえよう。 ところで、こうした世論の、人気の動向に対して、最も敏感なものが、ユスリ屋と、それから検察当局との二者である。暴力と権力。不法を行うものと、正法を行使するものと、両極瑞が前後して動きだした。 無法者では、ジャーナリスト、ゴロツキ。政治ゴロツキ。宗教ゴロツキ、カストリゴロツキなどが、あの手、この手と押しかけたらしいが、手ごわくか、あるいは手柔らかくか、とにかく刎ねつけられて、トンと物にはならなかったらしい。 しかし、国家の法律を持って臨む警察力というものは、しかし、アッサリとは退却しない。 「なんとかして、岡田というやっを引ッ括ってやろう。どうにかして、メシヤ教を叩き潰してやらなきゃ……」 この一念が凝って、疾風迅雷の動きを見せたのが、昨年の六月である。 静岡の検察庁が奮起したのである。教組岡田茂吉氏は拘引され、監禁された。 熱海と、箱根の同教本部は一せいに手入れをうけ、厳重な家宅捜索をうけた。 「やったっ！ ついにやっつけた」 「天網恢恢粗にして洩らさすだ」 「どうか中途年端な処分でなく、徹底的に潰滅させて貰いたい」 司法官憲のこの壮挙は、世間の期待にピタリと嵌ったのである。 教主岡田茂吉の人間研究 一 何の飾りっ気もない、ただ簡素で、明るくて清潔な講堂で、メシヤ教の岡田教主は、毎日何百人かの善男善女を集め、まるで町内会のような形式で、談笑のうちに彼一流のお説教をくり展げている。 ――本教を平易な言葉で表わそうと思ったら、デパート教、これでもいいです。私が常に言っていることだが、本教には、基督教、神道、仏教、儒教、それから哲学、科学、文学芸術、なんでもが包含されています。それらの中で特に努力しているものに、科学の面では、病気と健康の問題、それから農耕の問題があり、他の面では芸術があります。 もちろん、本教はその名の示す如く、救世の大業を遂行するのが目的である以上、一切万有を救わなくてはなりよせん。故に、人事百般、いかなることにも、その誤りを指摘して、これに最高至上の指針を与えなけれはならないのは当然です。 いかにも現代文化の進歩は素晴らしいには相違ないが、同時に、欠点も素晴らしい。ところが、表面に現われている側は人の眼に見えるからいいとしても、内側、内面的欠陥は眼に見えにくい。そこでこれは、神の光明叡智に照らし出して是正するよりほかにしかたはないのです。 この意味から本教は、あらゆる既存文化の面にメスを入れて解剖し、その実態を明かにし、より良き世界の実現をと企図するものでありまして、かくいたしてこそ「天国的文化時代」の到来を期待し得るのであります―― そういうことを説いているかと思うと、 ――降参日本が、やっと講和日本になろうとしているが、コーサン・ニッポン、コーワ・ニッホン、やがてまた昔のコーワイニポンにならなきャいいがね―― あるいはまた ――赤痢は昨年の三倍といい、結核はますます増える一方でどうにもテが無いと悲鳴をあげている。そうですかねえ、なるほど医学はたいしたもンだねえ、イヤサ進歩したもンでござンすねえだ。このぶんで行きャ、いまに八千万の大半が病人。そこで大病院や大製薬工場の濫立――政府も医者も、面見合せて青イキ吐イキ。そのとき、メシヤ教という迷信邪教の信者だけがピンピンしているとしたら、そのときこそは、政府も医者も、こちらに手を合わせ、オタ、オタ、オタスケ……泣いてくるンだ。愉快だね―― また、 ――世界も、国家も、個人も、あらゆる問題を解決する鍵は「誠」である。政治の貧困は誠の貧困に他ならず。物資の不足も「誠」の不足。道義の頻廃も「誠」の欠如。秩序の紊乱もまた、「誠」の無いところに生じる。あらゆる忌わしき問題は、みなすべて「誠」の不足に起因する。 宗教も芸術も学問も、芯に「誠」がなかッたら、それは形骸に過ぎないのだ。 ああ！誠なるかな、誠なるかな！人類よ、問題解決の鍵はただ「誠」あるのみ―― また、 ――真の信仰は、言語行動が常識にはずれないこと。世間よくある神憑り的な態度、奇怪な言説、奇矯な行動、そうしたことを標榜する信仰は、まず警戒を要する。 また、自己の属する集団以外とは親しめない、といったような独善的信仰もいけない。 世界全人類を救うのが、宗教の使命なりと信じ、自己にのみこだわらす、排他的とならないようにするのが、真の信仰というものである。あたかも、自己一国の利益のみに捉われ、他国民の利害を無視した結果、あの惨澹たる敗戦の苦盃をなめることとなった日本のありさまを思って見ることだ。 信仰究極の目的は、完全な人間を作り上げることだと、私は信じている。完全なる完全は望み得べくもなかろうが、よくなくとも、完全に近づこうとする努力、修養――これが正しい信仰の在り方だと思う。 故に、信仰に徹すれは徹するに従って、ますます平凡普通の人間に見えてこなくてはならない。そうなるためには、信仰を咀嚼し、消化することだ。言動はいかにも常識的で、万人に好感を与え、この人は何を信仰しているのかわからない、というくらいにならなくてはウソだ。人に接するや春風の如く軟く、しかも謙譲で、親切で、他人の幸福と社会福祉を冀うてやまぬような人間でありたい。 まず自己の幸福を欲するならば、他人を幸福にすること、他人を幸福にすることによって自己に与えられる神の恩賜こそが真の幸福である―― また、 ――宗教と芸術の関係、因縁。人間の情操を高め、生活を豊かに、人生を楽しく意義あらしむるもの、それは実に芸術の使命である。 われらが理想とする地上天国は「芸術の世界」と言っても言い過ぎではない。それは「真、善、美」の世界であるが、芸術はその中の「美」の分野であろう。昔の高僧は、絵を描き、彫刻を得意とし、堂宇までを設計するが如き、驚くべき美の天才を発揮している。そうした人々の中でも、最も傑出した宗教芸術家として、聖徳太子を挙げることが出来よう。大和法隆寺のあの建築そこに内蔵する絵画、彫刻などの美術を見るとき、今を去る千二百年もの昔に、これだけの傑作を産み出したという素晴らしさに同感しない人はあるまい。私は、だから大いに芸術を鼓吹しようと考えているのだ―― も一つ、 ――いまの日本に不足しているもの、 米でなし、鉄でなく、石油でなし、金でない、電力でも、警察予備隊でも、結核患者のベッドでもない。一たい何だと訊くか。 なんでもありやァしないよ。ただ神に合掌する人間が不足なだけなんだよ。 どうしたい？ 眼を白黒させてやがらァ―― 更にこれは、徳川夢声君と岡田氏との対談だが、しかしあの週刊朝日に載ったあれとは別なもので、去る三月二十一日、夢声君の、講談というか何というか、例の吉川英治原作宮本武蔵、宝蔵院道場の一席を、岡田氏が聴いたそのあとでの両人の座談である。 岡田「よかったですね、あなたの武蔵、講談などと異った味だ」 夢声「原作者吉川さんと私との、試合のようなものでしてね」 岡田「非常に巧い。結極、魂の問題です」 夢声「私は週刊朝日で対談をやっていますが、どうです、私と一度おやりになりませんか。絶対相手を傷つけるようなことはしないつもりです」 岡田「ええやりましょう……あなたはクセ者型ですよ」 夢声「クセ者型はおそれ入ります。それはそちらさんも……でしょう」 岡田「わたしャ、そういう人が好きですね。何か一くせある人は面白い。つまりバランスのとれた人物という意味でね」 夢声「そのバランスを説教するんですか」 岡田「それを説くのはむつかしいですね」 夢声「ときに、霊というものはですな、私は、科学がもすこし進歩したら、これを測定出来るのではないかと思いますが……」 岡田「それは出来ます」 夢声「何か、ガイカース氏の、あの放射能測定みたいに」 岡田「つまり、機械で測定出来るようになりますよ。舌はそうした論文を、いま執筆中ですがね、現在の原子科学は中間子理論で行詰っているんだそうです。中間子も湯川さんが、偶然宇宙線の写真の中に発見されて確証されたんですが、これをもっと突き進めると、機城では測定出来ません。ズーッと先きへ行けば神に到達します。やがては科学の進歩によって実証されるでしょうが、現在ではこの中間子の極点と、神との間が空白になっている。そこまでは科学者の頭が行っていないのです。わたしはこれを科学的に説明して、理論神霊学と名付けています。これを読めばわからない筈はない。この手を、こう翳すと、すぐ病気がなおる。盲腸炎など実によく治る。これが即ち、実験神霊学なのですよ」 夢声「わたしは腹痛の場合、手をそこにあてて暫くそうしていると治ることがよくあるんですが、確に手から大変ないいものが出ています。霊気といいますかね」 岡田「それを説くのは、なかなかむつかしいことです」 夢声「いや、どうも有難うごぎいよした」 二 岡田茂吉という人の来歴、その生いたちというものは、まるで大衆小説のお涙頂戴物そっくりである。 この人は明治十五年に、東京浅草の橋場に生れたというが、橋場といえば当時は貧民街に近いような地域だった。そして明治の十五年ごろという年代は、文化の黎明に、弱少国日本が、ヒョロリ、クラリと歩き出したばかりで、非常に足もとの暗い、こんとんとした時代であったし、また、明治十年、あの西郷隆盛の西南の役があわった直後で、民のカマドに炊煙が絶えたといってもいいような不景気のドン底時代でもあった。徳川の永い間の封建制がたおれたけれど、それに代って更に、薩、長の藩閥封建が民衆の頭上を凍雲のように覆い固め、自由の太陽を冷たく遮断している。 「われらの自由を取り戻せよ！われらに民権を返せ！」 板垣退助や、いまのワンマン総理の父親竹内綱なぞが、百姓と町人を指導し、大いに自由民権のノロシをあげようとしたが、その板垣を、岐阜の演説会場に刺したものがあった。血にまみれて打ちたおれながら、「板垣死すとも自由は死せす」と絶叫して満天下の民衆を号泣させたのも、ちょうど明治十五年であった。 国も民も、そうした無明の嵐に吹き晒されているさなかに、怪物か聖者かと問題にされる後年の岡田茂吉は、まだ江戸のゴミがそのままにカビくさく匂っている細民窟で、古道具屋の伜と生れたのであった。 古道具屋といってもピンからキリまであるが、彼の父親は非常に貧乏していたから、これはピンでなく、キリの方に近いガラクタ屋に過ぎなかったらしい。もっとも彼の家系は、ゴンゲンさまこのかた、七、八代連綿たる江戸ッ児で、祖父の代までは有福な町人だったというが、ともかく彼は赤貧洗うが如き、店の間三畳、居間四畳、たったそれだけの家庭で、日陰の苔のように生い育ったのである。 店といっても、橋場の貧乏長屋へ、金の茶釜など掘り出しにくる客のあろう筈はない。日暮れを待って、そこから十町ばかりの、浅草の露店を出しに行く渡世なのだ。それも雨が降ればアブレてしまう。どうにか落ちていないかぎり、父親は小さな荷車に、僅少なガラクタを載せ、栄養失調の母親が、同じく栄養不足で枯木のように見える乳呑児をサルぐくりに、そのあとを押して出かける。ありがたや、観音さまの慈悲の袖。いくらかの鳥もくを握って、夜泣きゾバ一ぱいを、夫婦で半分わけの夜食に啜り、飢えた児にもその汁を吸わせて、夜更けの橋場に帰ってくる。その帰りみち、米屋を叩いて借りを払い、あすのお粥のシロに、一合か五勺を袋に入れて貰う。だから、雨が、ものの三日も降りつづくともうこの一家は釜のフタがあかない。父の顔は土のように蒼ざめ、母の乳房は梅干のように凋んでしまう。赤ン坊は消え入るように泣く。いくら泣いたって乳は一滴も出ない。やつれた母が、痩せた児を抱え、近所合壁に貰い乳をして歩く。 それでも赤ン坊は、どうにか生きて育った。育つには育ったが、こんな環境で完全な健康に育つ筈はない。少年茂吉は、かぼそい体躯に、あらゆる病弱の素を植えつけられながらどうにか、こうにか、小学校に通う年ごろとなった。 貧しくはあったがしかし、この古道具屋夫婦は、信仰に篤い性質のものだったようだ。産は破れても、心は破れない夫婦だったのだろう。乏しさの限りを、なおギリギリに切りつめても、子供の教育だけはおろそかにはしなかった。ところでこの、栄養不良の病弱児童だが、学校に上げてみると、バカに成績がいい。たいていは級の一番、一番に外れても、三番とさがることはなかった。まったく親子協力の、螢雪の苦を積んでいった。 燈下親しみ、また薬餌にも親しみ通した。眼病、頭痛、腹痛、下痢――年中カゼをひき、いつも咳をしていて、遊びともだちの健康さを羨望しつづけた。 明治二十八年、学業優良、体質劣弱の岡田茂吉少年は、首席で小学校を卒業した。明治二十八年といえば、日清戦争の終った年である。一将功成り万骨枯れ、二、三の豪商富み栄え、何千万の民、重税に痩せ細ったころである。 浅草貧民窟のガラクタ道具屋では、貧しい夫婦が夜毎重大会議を開いていた。可愛いムスコを上の学校に上げるかどうか、という懸案についてである。 ムスコは美術学校に入れてくれろ、将来世界第一の絵描きになるンだという。 五六十年も昔の、場末の露天商い渡世で、子供を高等小学校まで出すということは、今日の貧民階級が、大学を卒業させる以上に異常のフンパツだった。しかも、この露天商人のムスコは、まだその上の学校に行きたいと泣いてたのむのだった。 けっきょく、夫婦の寿命を削っても、この児には学問をさせるべきだという結論に到達した。食うや食わすでためた金が何十円かになっていた。当時の何十円、今日の何千円？一万近い金だったろう。 美術学校の予備校に入学させられた茂吉少年の歓喜は言語に絶するほどのものだったろう。青い鳥は目の前を飛んでいたろう。 だが彼は烈しい眼病にたおれてしまった。入学わずかに半歳、ついに中途退学せざるを得なかった。盲目になりかかったのだ。 ああ！ 神も仏もないものかと、親も子もともに動哭した。 眼病の上に、更に肋膜炎が襲いかかった。すでに眼病で二カ年の間、あらゆる眼科病院を巡礼し、すこしの効果も見えなかったが、十数年父母惨苦の貯蓄は、学費でなくて医薬のために費消しつくした。さてロクマク。もはや金がないからやむを得ず大学病院の施療患者となって入院し、胸に孔をあけて水をとり、半歳で退院したが、一年後に再発。 これが漸時悪化の病勢をとり、更に一年余り経ったこと、堂々たる肺結核に進んだ。父母はまた、治療費のため、食うや食わずの苦行をつづけた。入沢博士により、不治の宣告をうけた。しかし爾来数年、菜食一点張りの自己療養でどうにか健康をとり戻した。だが、この小康を取り戻すための犠牲となって、辛酸以外に何物にも恵まれなかった父の一生が亡びた。父。えらい父だった。彼二十五歳、母と二人、九尺間口の店を借りて小間物屋を営むだけの資金が、父の預金通帳に蓄わえられてあったのだ。 「スキ油一個、一銭、へいまい度ありがとうございます」――といった彼の人世首途。 不慣れな仕事に精根を涸らしているうち、半年ばかりで烈しい心身の衰弱に陥り、脳貧血となり、往来で、電車の轢る音に眩暈を起こして卒倒したり、十分間くらいも他人と話をしていると、口がきけなくなッてフラフラするような状態だった。 こうした病躯を、灸と散歩で癒し、商買の努力をつづけていると、しだいに店が発展し、ついに小売屋から却問屋となり、十年後には京橋で一流のノレンに数えられるほどに成功した。しかし病気の方も、いよいよますます盛んにして、毎年三度くらいは病気に罹る。その病気は、さすが小間物屋だけに、種々雑多な種類を経験する。まず歯痛。毎日四五本の歯が順々に痛む。その痛みたるや、彼を何度も自殺に馳りたてたほどの猛烈さだった。 それから重症チブス。このときはついに、遺言をして入院した。でも三カ月で治った。次が痔の出血、それで入院一カ月、次いで胃病。次がレオマチス、それから尿道炎――そしてこの間を、頻繁にして執拗な扁桃腺炎、神経衰弱、頭痛、腸カタルなどが、さながら伴奏の如くに点綴するのだった。 この病気に並行して、しかし商買は順調に発展し、父の残した三千五百円で始めた店が十年あまりで十五万円ばかりの資産を産んだ。大正八年ごろのことだから、その十五万円はたいしたもので、東京一流の大問屋として認められるようになった。ところで、茂吉さんは更にこれを百万円に太らせようと計画し、店を資本金二百万円の株式会社に変更し自分で社長となって健闘した。 百万円、それは今日の貨幣価値に換算すれは何億という巨額であろう。なんのためにかくも途方もない大プランをたてたかというに、それが実に、朝日、毎日に劣らぬほどの新聞社をつくろうという下心なのである。 そんな新聞をつくってどうするのかといえは、それによってあらゆる社会悪を打倒し、政治を改革し、一挙にしてこの地上に天国を出現させようとする、三十八歳の岡田青年の夢なのだ。 当時、日本は第一次欧洲大戦直後の黄金時代であった。カイザーのドイツは亡び、ツアーのロシアも亡び、英、米、仏その他目ぼしい欧洲の諸強国が戦傷のいたでに喘ぎつつあるとき、大いに火事場泥棒を稼いで肥った日本である。 不義の富貴、浮雲の栄華、王侯、貴族、富豪、政治家、官吏 町人、百姓、みな滔々として腐敗堕落の段階を転落していた。 そして天譴！ 大正十年春の第パニック。一朝にして肥大したこの国の経済は、一夜にして土崩瓦解し去った。残骸、死屍累々――その中に、ごたぶんに洩れず、二百万円の岡田株式金融の夢のカケラも踏み潰されてあったのだ。 しかし、馬車馬のような岡田茂吉は、そのガラガラから再び経ち上った。なにがどうあろうと、新聞を！という熱意に燃え立っているのだった。そして再び、百万円の夢が現実に近づくかに見えたとき、取引銀行が取付けにあい、支払停止――やがて破産。彼もまた破産。でも三度び立ち上った。そのとき、最愛の、苦楽をともにと誓い合って来た妻が、病気に罹り、間もなく妊娠五カ月の体で亡くなった。 まことに悲風、惨雨。荒涼たる彼の人生であった。打ちつすく不幸の連打に、彼は心のよりどころを神に求めて宗教巡礼者となッた。 しかし、百万円の夢は決して忘れない。四度び奮起し、ようやくにして岡田株式金融の整理と出発を見た。いざこれから、最後の運だめしというところで、またしてもガラガラッと例の大正十二年の大震災であった。 もはや致命的な痛打である。かくなる上は、すべてをすてて神。神を求めて、永遠の遍路にと出発するよりほかに、生きる力も、めどもありはしなかッた。 彼は大本教に入信した。大本教が、当時の宗教としては、最も新鮮に、清気ある宗教だったから、つまり、旧い死火山ばかりの宗教界で、ひとりこの宗門のみが生きていると見たからであるが、それにしても、徹底せるリアリストで、コチコチに頑固な無神論者だった彼が、ここに生命の泉を求めようとしたのはよくよくのことである。 生前の現実に破れたところの敗者が、宗教というオアシスに逃げ込むという、これは普通のことだが、この人の場合は単にそれだけの理由ではなかった。やはり新聞に代るものとしてここに走ったという意味もあるのだった。社会悪を滅ぼすための闘いに、新聞なぞは手ぬるし。どうしても、人間の魂を根底から揺り動かして目醒めさせる以外に、悪のない社会を出現せしめる道はない。その人間の魂を揺り醒ますものはまた、宗教以外には無い。そのまた宗教の中で、そうした希望を満たしてしれるものは、大本教以外には無い。と、そこで彼は大本教に入り、忽ちにして熱心な――それはまったく、寝食を忘れるほどに熱心な信者――信者というよりも、神霊の有無、神と人との関係、信仰の妙諦、それの探究者となったのである。 昭和三年。東京の商人岡田茂吉は、完全に脱皮して、一人の、神の使徒と更生した。 それからの六年間、彼は物質以外に、天地の霊、宇宙の霊を認め、また神霊による病気治療の確信を、固く把握した。そして大本教の幹部となり、出口王仁三郎師からの深い信頼も得た。しかるにその後出口王仁三郎師から最早や学び取る何ものもなくなったことを知る様になった。 ああ、大本教ももはやおしまいだ！と岡田氏はひそかに心を決し、昭和九年の秋、ついに職を辞して同教団を離れたのであった。果然、その翌年である。大本教が不敬罪のかどで大断圧を吃したのが。 そこで岡田氏は、その昭和九年の五月、東京麹町の平川町に一戸を構え「応神堂」の看板をあげ「信仰的指圧療法」といった意味の治療所を開いた。 さてここで、観音教由来ということになるのだが、大変な奇蹟があらわれた。 それは、ある日、某なる男が訪ねて来たので、自分が床の間に坐っている写真をその男に撮らセ、これを現像してみると、自分の横ッ腹あたりから、もうもうたる、白雲か、霧がみたいなものが立ち昇っていて、その煙のような中に、ありありと、観音菩薩の像が映っているのだ。 「これァなんだ？どうしたんだ、これは」 「さァ不思議ですね」 という騒ぎだ。床の間にも、どこにも、この家に観音さまなぞ、絵も、彫刻もありはせぬ。 「何か、トリックじゃないのか」 「とんでもない。乾板を調べれは、トリックでしたか、どうか、玄人にはすぐ判りますよ」 彼は観音の加護を信じた。やがて、観音の意志を知った。つまり、神はこの自分を用いて、この世の人間苦を救い、光明の世界を現出させようと試みているのだという確信を得た。 信者も相当の数に植えた。みな岡田氏の「信仰的指庄療法」によって、それぞれに病気を治して貰った人々であるが、この信徒を擁して「大日本観音会」というものが出発することとなった。昭和十年一月である。 三 翌年の夏、埼玉県大宮警察から、彼は医師法違反の件で呼び出しをうけた。 太宮の片倉製糸工場で、岡田の弟子の武井某（大日本観音会埼玉支部長）が、女工を何十人か治療したことが引っかかりとなったのだ。むろん武井は留置されている。そこへ岡田氏が呼び出されて、司法主任からイキナリ、 「お前が生き神様か」 と訊かれた。 「いいえ、私はそんなものではないです」 「黙れ！ウソをいうと承知せんぞ。いいか、信者はキサマを生神さまじゃというとる。よし、生き神さまなら罰をあてることが出来るだろう。やってみろ」 そばに立っていた二人の刑事へ、この主任が四角い頤（おとがい）を振ると、ヤニワに二人が、右左から、岡田氏の髪の毛を掴んで引っぱり合いをはじめた。痛い、実に、斬られるよりも痛い。泣きそうになりながら、どうか許してくださいと彼はひらあやまりにあやまった。 「よし、それでも、キサマの写真のことについて訊くが、霊写真とかいうて、観音様の映ったインチキ写真を祭ッとるそうだね」 「インチキではありません」 「ごまかしても駄目だ。あのトリックは、どうしてつくッたのだ。正直に言うてみろッ」 「トリックなぞじャないです、実は、某という男が私を訪ねて来まして、いろいろ宗教上の意見を語り合ったとき、この男が、あとで私を撮影したのです。むろんその男は、写真の方は素人です。ところが焼きつけてみると、その写真が、ああした不思議な現象をみせたんですよ」 ここでまた、例の二人の刑事が、竹刀をふり翳して岡田氏の両側から迫まって来た。 「キサマは図々しいやつだ。正直なことを言わんと腰っ骨をブッ砕いてやるぞ、いいか」 「どうだ、もう一ペン言ってみろ。ハッキリと、どうだ」 うかつには口も利けないと思い、いつまでも眼をつむって黙り込んでいた。すると、トタンに「痛いッ、あ痛イ」と、一人の刑事が頭をかかえて妙な顔をしだした。 「どうした。君」 「急に頭が、割れるようなんだ。変だなァこのインチキ野郎め、罰をあてやがった」 「バカ。神経だよ、バカな」 もう一人の刑事は笑い出したが、その男もまた、妙な顔をし、横腹を圧さえていたが、やがて二人とも、消えるようにその部屋を出て行った。その間に司法主任は調書を書きあげ、これに捺印しろと突き出した。その文面によると、霊観音の写真は、実は私がつくりました美術写真の一種であります、といった意味のことがしるしてある。 異議を称えればまた拷問される。その苦痛がたまらないので、ヤケ気味になり、ええくそっとばかり、それに捺印してしまった。 そしてその日はブタ箱で夜を明かし、翌日は帰宅をゆるされたが、すぐまた、所轄の玉川署に引致され、十二日間をブタ箱に閉じこめられた。彼は当時玉川の畔（ほと）り上野毛に住み、そこで営業していたからである。 ついに治療を禁止された、治療を禁止されては生活することが出来ない。いろいろと歎願運動をし、結極「宗教的」という、その宗教をやめ、単なる治療屋として営業を許されることになったが、それから四年経った昭和十五年に、また玉川署のブタ箱へブチ込まれた。今度は医師法違反。 患者に対し、これは医者にかかる必要はない。わしの治療で完全に治るといい、そして医者に行くことを妨害し、治療を行って治癒せしめた。これ即ち医師法違反なり、というのだった。 この調子ではまたも再び営業禁止だろうと思い、 「病気を治すことが医師法違反と言われるのでしたら、この私の営業は成り立ちません。私はすぐに廃業します」 これは、意地悪い司法主任の、鼻のさきを、パチン！と指で弾じきとばしたような結果となった。営業を禁止するぞ！と脅かすつもりでいたその先手を打たれ、やめますと言い出されたので、主任もポカンとなり、やがて、ムッと怒り、三日ばかりまた、ブタ箱に閉じ込めて置いた。 「おい、おまえは療術行為をやめると言ったな。よし！誓約書を書け。どんなことがあっても、一生涯、コンリンざいやりませんという誓約書だ」 三日後に、ブタ箱から引き出して、主任殿の喧嘩腰だ。よッぽど口惜しかったものと見える。 それから一年経った。警視庁から、療術行為の届出をして貰いたいと言って来た。 弾圧してやめさせた治療行為を、再びやりなさいというのだ。とんでもない話だが、岡田氏にはその内情が読めている。おかしくてたまらない。 そのころの大臣某氏、陸軍大将某、大実業家某々などが、岡田氏のもとに治療を頼んでくる。岡田はそれを刎ねつける。警察から苛められ、昨年限りやめました。いかなるわけがあろうとも、金輪際やりませぬという誓約書を書かされたのですから……。 大臣、軍人、金持、そうした階級の走狗であった警視庁だから、怪しからんじャないか、万人を救う岡田の治療を、なぜ断圧したのだ。バカなことをすると承知せんぞと叱りつけられた警察は、一も二もなくひれひれ伏して、早速ながら「治療行為」をやるという届けを出してくれと、妙な嘆願に及んだしだいなのだ。 四 「信仰」「信」「信は力なり」 「己」「自我」「私」私を無くすること――己れを空しくすること。己れを絶し切った窮極の心に神が宿る。「則天去私」 「神とは、宇宙の精神である。宇宙の精神、即ち神の意志は、これは絶対無限の愛、大いなる愛に他ならぬ」 「宗教は迷信なり。宗教はアヘンなり」というのは「極端な唯物主義者の偏見であり、無学なインテリ大衆の、小児病的なカタコトに過ぎぬ。真実の大宇宙の精神に触れようとするためには、人間は、もっと、もっと学問を高めなくてはならぬ。学問の中でも、特に「スピリチュアリズム――神霊主義を究わめねばならぬ。これは、唯物主義科学に対立するものではなく、その上に在るものだ。より高く、より深い精神的なるものの究極が、宗教となるのだ。それは当然である」 岡田氏の骨を削るような精進工夫が、ついにここにまで到達したとき、彼は豁然として神の啓示を悟った。 もともと彼は、一介の江戸ッ児少年であった。貧しい家に産れ、ただ向学の念に燃える一介の貧書生に過ぎなかった。 決して、将来大宗教家になろうなぞとは、夢にも想ってはいなかった。まして、救世主になろうなぞという野望は、狂人でない彼の、抱き夢みる限界ではなかったのだ。 ただ、あまりにも惨酷な病苦と貧困とが、あわれな、小さな、迷える羊の彼を、自然に――あるいは無理やりに宗教の門へとつれて行ったのである。 そのために、彼は大本教にも入ったし、キリスト教、仏教その他あらゆる宗教の教義を研究もしたのであった。 彼は確に天才児であり、秀才であった。また、不撓不屈、おそろしく強靭な意志をも恵まれていた。殆ど人生の半ばを通じて、病床に悲痛な闘病と、苦学をつづけ得たのは、こうした天恵の力を、彼が本質的に恵まれていたからだと云えよう。まったく、異常な、想像以外の闘病と苦学だったらしい。 「岡田茂吉という人物は、あれはあの苦学で大学教授にでも、博士にでもなれた人ですね」 そういうふうに彼を見ている人々もある。その岡田氏は、博士にも教授にもならず、すっかり病魔を駆逐し去ったあげくは、世間からは按摩屋さんとも想われたりしたであろう指圧療法の先生になったのだが、それは彼が、あまりにも強く、烈しく「人間苦」の解決を求めた結果である。 この人世から、病と、貧と、争いとを無くするわけには行かないものか。 明けても暮れてもそれを思った。夢の中でもそれが念頭を去らなかった。それを思い念じることが、彼の生活の全部だったといってもよかった。 病、貧、争、これは輪廻である。三ッ巴である。どれが原因で、どこが結果ということはない。すべてが原因であり、すべてが結果である。国と国との戦争、個人と個人との相克。 彼が生れる前には、永い無明の幕末時代があった。明治のころになっても、国内の攘乱は絶えなかった。西南戦争がその大切解みたいな結果だった。それから日清戦争、日露戦争、第一次欧洲大戦、日華紛攘、満州事変、日華事変――。 彼の父母は、否、日本の大衆は、こうした戦乱紛争のさなかに痩せ衰えて行ったのだ。彼の両親が貧乏だったのも、その貧民の児の彼が病弱だったのも、すべては戦争が元だといえないだろうか。 借金をする人々、夜逃げをする人々。自殺する人々、肉親同志の喧嘩、他人同志の憎み合い、すべては貧が源である。あるいは病気が因である。しかし、貧、病は戦争の結果である。否、貧病が源で戦争、喧嘩が起るのだ。イヤそうではない――どこまで行っても、この輪廻には始めも終りもありはしない。 宗教、そうだ！宗教こそは、この闘、病、貧を払拭し去ってくれるものだ。と思いはしても、日本の宗教は戦争を援助していた。武運長久、敵国撃滅の護符を、さかんに売り出し、また盛大な祈祷をして兵士を戦場に送り出した。 将兵もまた、神や仏に祈りを捧げながら、勝ってくるぞと勇ましく、殺人、暴虐の首途をして行くのだった。 そうして、地球を血に染め、死屍を戦野に充満させ、悪疫と貧困で国土を枯疫させるのだった。 そうした現実をみて、岡田茂吉いかに秀才なりといえども、自己一身の名のために、大学教授や博士になりすまし、安閑としてはいられないのであった。ここに、彼の持って生れた《宿命》が潜在していたのである。 彼は異常な情念を産みつけられていた。この異常な情念がまた、異常な情熱を彼の体内に燃焼させた。そしてこの異常な情熱が、彼の場合は偉大な《誠実》となり、偉大な《人間愛、社会愛》に膨張したのであった。 今日の岡田氏は、甚だ恬淡にして洒々落々たる風貌、言行の士であり、私は難行苦行をしてこの宗法を弘通しようとしてはいない。すべては神任せだ。神が私という人間を必要とし、道具として私を使用しているのだから、私自身は極めて明るく楽しいのだ、と言っているが、それはそうだろう。現在においての彼の心境は、あるいはそうだろうが、しかし彼が、初めて神の啓示を大悟するまで、その以前にあっての彼の人間苦と惨澹たる思索の過程は、けだし想像に余るものがあったのだ。 何度自殺しようと考えたか。病苦のために、貧困のために、また人間悪、社会悪のために。思想を抱いているのは肉体である。霊、肉不二。即身、即仏。肉体が清浄となれは、霊の曇も頂き払われる。もしも、飢えたる肉体に美味な食物を給与することが出来たら？もしも、苦患の肉体を無病の神身に保証してやることが出来たら？もしも憎悪、闘争に憔悴しつつある人間に、無闘争の社会を与えてやることが出来たら？ それは出来るか？ あるいは不可能のことだろうか？ 神！ そうだ神によってのみ可能だ。すべては神の意志なのだ。 病苦も、修羅の苦も、神の意志にほかならぬ。 船が進む方向から、逆の風が吹いてくる。人間が生きて行こうとする真向いから、諸悪諸業が吹きつけてくる。 しかし船は、その逆風に対向して帆を張りあげる。帆は逆風を孕み、これを巧みに辷らせることによって、その逆風を利用し、却って船の推進力に変化させる。 そうだ！俺は神に向って帆を張ろう。と彼が思いついたとき、神はすでに彼の身心を帆としてその中に降臨していた。 彼の身に、彼を呆然自失させるような奇蹟が相続いで示現されだした。 幸福な人生を造りたい、われも人も。社会は天国のような楽園でありたい。この願い以上に、彼は何も望みはしなかった。別に、大聖者たらむとも、大宗教家、大救世主にならうとも、そうした野望は持ってはいなかった。警察の度び重なる断圧に嫌気がさし、ついに治療行為をやめたのが、昭和十五年の暮だった。岡田氏ときに五十九歳。 キリストも釈迦も再び生れ来よ 汝と吾れの力試さん 善きことを悪しと見らるゝ世にあつて 何とかせんや懐手すも 和歌の如き感想を発表して、ひたすら本教と、門弟の養成に邁進した。 その養成された多くの使徒たちのうちでも、渋井、中島などという人は錚々たるもので、渋井氏は「みろく会」を、中島氏は「天国会」を、それぞれ主宰して師岡田の下に従属した。 この国は無法な侵略戦争に突入し、敗色は日とともに色濃くなって来た。 十九年の初夏、観音教は箱根の強羅に、藤山愛一郎氏の別荘を買って疎開したが、その秋には、熱海で、山下亀三郎氏の別荘を買い、そこに引移った。いよいよ敗戦決定の二十年八月、彼は、呆然自失の信者たちを前に、 「これでいいんだ。日本が真に正しい国となる時機に到達したのである。ヤクザ日本が泥足を洗って堅気な日本に更正するのだ。神が、アメリカの手を借りてこの国に覚醒の大鉄槌を加え給うたのである」 と説いた。今日ならば誰にでも頷ける言葉だが、敗戦決定の当日、この言葉を聞かされた信者どもは、やはり呆然として、精神喪失者みたいな表情を傾けるばかりだった。 とにかく、こうした考え方をしている岡田氏だから、戦争中はいろいろな手で、警察から苛められ通したものである。 「お前の方で、病気を治すのは、観音さまのごりやくじャない。天皇陛下の御稜威で治るのじャ。だから病気が治った者は、二重橋のところへお礼に行け」 そんなことを言ってくる特高巡査もあった。熱海ではまた、三台あったラジオセットを悉く警察に没収された。アメリカと短波で何か通信し合っているというのだ。 いつも教団本部の前の家には刑事が張込んでいて、出入の信者をリストに記録した。 「岡田のやつ、なンとかして引ッくくってやろうと思うが、どうもうまく行かン。観音教は、是が非でも叩き潰してやりたんいだ。しかし、いくらやってみても、引ッくくる材料がなくて困っとるンじャ」 某警察署長が、新聞記者に、そんな述懐をもらしたこともあったという。 検察当局を苛々させながらも、観音教はしだいに発展し、世の智識階層を苦笑させるような奇蹟が、その何十万人という信者たちの上に、枚挙のいとまもないほどに顕現した。 インテリ階級は、この奇蹟を「偶然」だという。偶然とは、たまたま、稀に見る、思いもよらぬ事象の意味である。偶然が枚挙にいとまのないほど発生したのでは、もはやこれは、偶然ではなくて必然だろう。 ともかく、観音教は、信者三十万という大勢力に膨張して「世界救世教」と発展した。 「おい、メシヤ教は三十万の信者を擁しているそうだ。実にケシカラン」 「莫大なお賽銭をもて余し、熱海の山にパラダイスなぞを造営しているというぜ、まったく怪しからン。早く叩き潰さにャいかンね」 偏執狂じみたインテリ大衆の呪い。 この声に、国法の正しい運営を任務とする検察当局が耳をかたむけた。猛然崛起した。 いよいよ熱海の五・八事件突発となったしだいである。 法 難 いわゆる「法三章」で、法は僅か三章で足りる。むしろそれが理想なのだ。あるいは、三章をすら不必要とするのが窮極の理想である。政治の運営さえよろしければ……。 元来、法規はわれわれ俗人が、俗物の代議士を議会に送って立法させたもの、しこうしてまたわれわれが、われわれの公僕をしてこれを行使せしめているものである。 俗人がこさえて、俗吏が運営する法規である以上、法律というものは、神がつくって神これを行うところの天の摂理と比べては、遥に不完全かつ不規則なものに相違ない。いくら何万章の法をつくつてみても。だから、検察の局に当るものは、よくよくこの道理を弁まえ、自我を殺し、感情を滅し、ひたすら謙譲に、戦々兢々としてこれを行使しなくてはならぬということ、いまさら言を要しないところの常識である筈なのに――それなのに、静岡県の当局は一たい、どういう常識でなにを検顕しようとして、莫大な国民の税金を、このメシヤ教検挙に費消し、そうして如何なる収獲を、その結果に得たというのか！ あれだけの人と金と時とを費すのならば、もっと他に、やって貰いたい緊急のことが山ほどもあったのに――と今にしては、呆れている人々の方が多い。 去る昭和二十五年五月八日に始まり、同七月十二日までに一段落を見た、このメシヤ教検挙事件について、岡田氏はその著書「法難手記」で、大要次の如く語っている。 ―――――――――――――――――――― 警察官並びに検事の取調べは、到底想像だも出来ない程の、非民主的のものであった。若しかくの如き不合理が許されるとしたら、今後如何に多くの無辜の人民が災いせられ、苦難を被るかは、計り知れないものがあろう。如何に完璧なる憲法が制定されたとしても、その運営がこれに伴わないとすれば、折角得た自由も民主々義も、泥に踏み躙られる結果となるであろう。吾々は専門家ではないが、そもそも法の建前なるものは、善を勧め悪を懲らし、よりよき社会を作り、最大多数の最大幸福を実現する。それが基本的信念であらねばならぬと惟うのである。私は御承知の如く一宗教人ではあるが、宗教の本来も、よりよき人類社会の実現を目標とし、善を勧め悪を懲らし、理想世界を作るにあるのは言を俟たないのである。したがって、吾等が如何に宗教弘通に専念し、自由民主主義社会を企図するといえども、法の運営に当る人たちが、それに無理であるとしたら、これに覚醒を促がし、正しき認識の下に所期の目的を達せられん事を願望するのである。それがための一資料が些かなりとも、役立つとすれは、幸甚この上なき次第である。とは言うものの、省みれば、吾等といえども今回の事件によって、今までの経営が如何に杜撰放漫を極め、監督不行届であったかは、まことに自責の念に堪えないものがある。若し今回の事件なかりせば、放漫は不知不識の中に、幾多災いの種を蒔いたかも知れなかったので、大難が小難で済んだと思ったのである。全く神が当局の手を煩わして、一大粛正の思慮を垂れ給うたと信じ、今回の大いなる苦難も、神の愛の鞭でなくて、何であろうと深く省み、只々感謝感激あるのみである。 この意味においては、その鞭の役目を荷われた、当局者の労苦に対しても、深甚なる感謝を捧ぐるのである。 この著の題名を法難手記としたが、これを実際から言えば当らないかも知れない。と言うのは、彼の基督にしろ、日蓮、法然、親鸞、近くは天理教々祖にしろ、その開祖教祖が未だ現行の如き法のない時代であったに拘わらず、法難の言葉を用いられて来たのであるが、この法の意味は、今日の法律の法でばなく、仏教から出た言葉であろう。それは仏教の最初は仏法と呼ばれ、中途から仏教に転化したのであるから、この意味に於て、キリストの如きは法難ではなく、受難というべきであろう。 そうして私の今何の事件は、宗教上は何等関係がなく、単なる脱税問題が主であったから、法難ではなく法律難と言うのが妥当であろう。これは別の話ではあるが、天理教々祖中山ミキ刀自は、投獄さるる事十数何に及んだという事である。にも拘らず、今日の如き、隆昌を見るに到った事は、宗教に法難は附物であって、官憲が如何に強圧するといえども真に価値あるものなれば、決して挫折する事なく、いつかは社会から、認められるようになる事を知るのである。 次に、本著の目的について、今一つの重要事がある。御承知の如く、今度の事件発生するや、大抵の新聞紙には、特ダネ扱いに大々的に報道されたが、その記事を読んでみると、随分出鱈目が多いので、社会を誤るの甚しきを憂い、一応の弁明をなす必要あるを思うのである。 大手入れ 昭和二十五年五月八日未明、突如として青天の霹靂のごとく、本教関係の熱海所在の建物六カ所、小田原一カ所、、合計七カ所に対し、一大家宅捜索が行われた。その際動員された警官、無慮八十名というのであるから、いかに大仕掛であったかが判るのである。 ちょうど暁の大捕物という形だ。しかも全員ピストル携帯、物々しい出立ちは、最近行われたボスの、大親分検挙を思わしむるものがある。誰か、宗教団体がこのような扱いを受けるなどと、想像されたであろう。 終戦前、彼の大本教や、人の道教等が、大弾圧を喫したその記憶は、未だ吾等の頭にも残っているが、その頃の宗教関係事件と言えば、殆んどは、不敬罪と婦人関係で、これが通り相場のようになっていた。しかし不敬罪は、今日跡方もなく消えてしまったし、エロ問題も本教に限ってない事は、世間誰でも知っている。とすれば一体全体何の容疑なのか、全然見当がつかない。ただ不思議というより外はない。そこで捜査の遣り方によって、判断するより外に考えようがないから、家人や立会った人達に詳しく聞いてみた。 まず、五月八日午前五時三十分、私は急に眼が醒めた。すると台所の方で、何か騒がしい音がすると思うや、一人の女中が慌ただしく部屋へ入って来た『今警察の方が大勢見えて調べに来たと言うのです』私は驚くと共に不思議で堪らない。次の間に寝ていた妻はソッと襖を開け、私に近寄り小声で『あなた泥棒じゃないですか？』と言う。私は『真暗な夜中ならとにかく、夜が明けた今そんな筈はない確かに警察官だよ』と言うか言わない内、早次の間へ入つて来たらしい気配がする。慌てて次の間へ引っ返した妻は、まだ信じられないと見え、相手に向って『あなたは泥棒じゃありませんか？』といっている。『イヤ、僕はこういう者だ』と令状をみせたらしい。妻は『それではどうぞお調べ下さい』という。私は事態容易ならずと床を蹴って襖を開けてみると、 なるほど警官らしい一人が、キョロキョロ辺りを見廻している。彼は私に対って〃起きるには及ばん、寝ていなさい〃というので、私も寝てた方が捜査に都合がいいのだろうと察して床に入ったが、胸がドキドキして眠る処ではない。しかし別に家宅捜索されても心配の点は些かも無いのだが、落着けないのは人間誰もがもつ、共通心理であると思ったりした。私は朝飯の仕度が出来たので起床し、不味いのを我慢しながら一杯で済ました。心配事があると何よりも食事に影響する事がつくづく思われた。その時乗り込んで来た私服は、十二三人であった事を後から聞いた。それから彼等は家中隅なく捜査し、書類やら郵便物、銀行通帳、現金及び数百枚の名刺等々、調査資料になりそうな物は、悉く押収して引揚げたのである。何でも後で聞いた女中の話によると、六畳の女中部屋を六七人の警官が、三時間もかかって調べたのだという。もっとも数人の女中の行李であるから、相当品数はあったであろうが、何しろ腰巻からズロース迄も一枚一枚丹念に調べたというのだから推して知るべきだ。役人何れも〃変だな、ヘンだな〃を連呼していたそうである。察するに大きな期待をかけていた隠匿物が見当らなかったからであろう、とは誰もが語り合った話である。総勢引揚げたのは午後三時頃であったから、食事の時間を差引いても悠に八時間に及んだ訳である。 右は私の住宅であるが、熱海清水町にある別院のごときは、押入の根太を外して縁の下迄調べたそうであるから、いかに大きな期待をかけて来たかが判るのである。又私の旧住宅である熱海東山の家には金庫があったが、長い間使わなかったため、番号を覚えている者がいないので、開ける事が出来ず封印をして帰り、その後数日経って三人の警吏が来て漸く開けたが、何もなかったので大いに失望して帰ったとの事を、留守番から聞いたのである。その後五月三十日箱根強羅の別院へ、総勢五十人の警吏が乗込んで、数時間に渉って頗る綿密な捜索を行った由であるが、この時は私は抑留中であったため、後で聞いたのである。 以上のような大々的家宅捜索が行われたに拘わらず、泰山鳴動式に終ったのであるが、しかし考えれば考える程、どういう訳でこのような大掛りな捜査をしたかと言う事である。実に判らない。みんなの一致した観方は、余程の隠匿物資があるとみて来たらしいという。ところが令状には金久平に関する贈賄容疑としてあるので、それ位の容疑で武装警官八十人とはいよいよもって判らない。しかもその時私の秘書井上福夫、造営部熱海主任金久平の二人まで逮捕留置されたというのである。 このような訳で、当局の意図なるものはサッパリ見当がつかない。それだけ何かしら穏かならぬものを感じない訳にはゆかない。もちろん井上も金も弁護士を頼んだのであるが、それから私の身の上を心配した信者の誰彼は、知合の弁護士を頼んでくれたり、連れて来たりして慰めてくれた。なお、これ以上進展するかもしれないという観念からその対策を相談した事もあった。というのは井上も金も二三日で帰るだろうと思ったのに、一週間経ち二週間経っても帰らない。井上にしろ金にしろ大した犯罪など犯すような人間でない事は、永い間部下として使った経験によっても明かである。殊に井上の如きは二十年前から忠実に仕えており、今日は家族同様の待遇さえ与えていたからである。 右の両人が引張られる余程前から、信者である銀行員山田仁太郎が抑留されている事を聞いたが、罪状は浮貸問題とかであった。同氏は以前は時々来たが、今年になってからは、一回面会しただけで、御無沙汰勝ちとなっていたので、彼の事情については、知る由もないが、彼とても信者である以上、それ程間違った事を、する筈がないと思ったが、これもサッパリ見当がつかない。又こういう説をする者もあった。それは例のユスリの一団が当局を動かしたのではないかというのである。ここでこのユスリ団を、詳しくかく必要があろう。 強 請 団 このユスリ団というのは、一、二年前から本教団を狙っており、目的は、巨額の金銭を拝得しようとして、あの手、この手の策略を用いて、教団を執拗に揺ぶるのである。噂によると国会議員数人を初め、宗教人、旧右翼系の利者、本教の反対者等々、少くとも十人内外の者が一団となって謀略を廻らし、当局はもとより司令部方面に迄働きかけ、本教団を伏魔殿のように思わしめ、結局解散一歩手前に迄追いつめておいて、それを免がれるには巨額の運動費が必要であると持ちかけ、何千万円の大金をせしめようと、企んでいると言うのである。そうして右の計画を達成するための宣伝としては、本教は医学を誹謗するとか、無肥料栽培は、怪しからぬなどと言い、脱税問題、贈賄問題等その他種々の捏造やデマを絡ませ、特に彼等が力を注いでいるのは、物資隠匿である。ヤレ金塊やダイヤモンド、何億を隠匿しているとか言うのだから、当局を刺戟するには絶好の資料である。その他新聞雑誌を悪用し、デマを飛ばし世論を作り、世論からみて本教の存在がいかにも、社会に害あるごとく思わしむる等、あらゆる苦肉の手段を弄し、目的を達しなければ止まないというような気構えであった。その現われの一つとして昨年夏ＣＩＤの大袈裟な手入れがあった。忘れもしない八月二十五日夜九時頃、箱根強羅別院に千人程の部員が突如家宅捜索に来たのである。容疑は多量の金塊、白金及びダイヤモンドを、ドラム缶一杯に入れて隠匿しているというのである。それが頗る確信に満ちているようで二日に渉って厳重なる家宅捜索をなし、最後にはレーダー迄も使用し、住宅の床下の土まで掘起した程であったに拘わらず、この時も泰山鳴動して鼠一匹も出なかったので、事なく済んだが、訊いてみると密告と投書によったと言うのである。彼等ユスリ団がこのように官憲を欺瞞し、躍らせる巧妙さは感嘆に堪えないのである。かように私利の為に罪なき良民を苦しめても、何ら法の制裁を受ける事なく、公然として社会を横行し、良民がいつも被害を受け泣寝入りに終るのであるから、善人は損をし、悪人は得をするという結果になるので、全く法の制度か又は運営に欠陥があるのか、ともかく軽視出来ない問題である。今回の家宅捜索がＣＩＤの手入れの当時を知っている人々の多くは、隠匿物資の疑いの点が余りによく似ていると話し合っているのを私は聞いたのである。 前述のごとく、信者が紹介したり、連れて来た弁護士達が、いかに何でも明主様が引張られるような事は、万あるまいという意見の方が多かった。そんな訳で私としても、呼び出し位の事はあるかも知れないが、拘留などは絶対ないと安心していたのである。ところが五月二十九日、家宅捜索のあった八日の日から数えて二十一日目の二十九日未明、就寝中の私は突如起された。見ると静岡県清水市庵原警察署、刑事部長Ｋ氏という名刺を出し、一人の刑事を伴い、私に対って「直ちに同行されたい」と言うので、私は愕然とした。余りに意外であったからである。その時私はこう言った。〃部下が長い間取調べを受けているのは、何か氷解しない点があるからであろう。それで一度私の口から充分説明したら解るだらうと思っていたので、ちょうどよい〃と快諾した。途中自動車の故障などがあって大分遅延したが、零時半警察署の門をくぐり、留置所へ入れられたのである。留置所の経験は昭和十一年二回、同十五年一回あったが、一回目は二日、二回目は十一日、三回目は三日間であつた。一、二回共宗教問題で、三回目は医師法違反でいずれも無罪であった。当時の調べは三回共特高であったが、特高の調べなどというと、非常に封建的であるように想像されるが、今回の取調べに較べてみると、比較にならぬ程、今度の方が峻厳苛烈で、戦慄の一語につきると言ってもいい。 最初の取調べ 警察に拘留された一日目は、簡単な取調べで終ったが、第二日目であった。朝飯を済ますや直ちに二階の調室に連れられた。Ｋ刑事部長、Ｍ刑事部長の二人の外に、Ｓ警部という人が応援として、静岡市国警本部からこの朝出張して来たと言われた。ここで右の三人に就て感じたままをかいてみるが、Ｋ氏はどちらかといえは、物柔かい親しみ易い人であったが、Ｍ氏はいかにも調べ役人型で峻烈である。まずＭ氏は親父型、Ｋ氏は女房型と言つてよかろう。Ｓ警部は頑丈な軍人タイプの人で、迫力があり被告は威圧される感じである。 いよいよ、取調べは始まった。私を取囲んで三人は代る代る訊問を始めた。最初は静岡銀行沼津支店、行員山田仁太郎氏に関する件であったが、正直に言えいうので、知っている事は知っている、知らない事は知らないというと、三人は声を揃えて『君は知らない筈はない。呆気たり、嘘を言ったりすると承知せんぞ、井上の言う事も、山田の言う事も一致している以上、君ひとり違うと言っても、二対一では君の方が間違っているに決っている』と一喝された。私は『いくら考えても私の方が本当だと思う』と言うと、三人は納得せす、どこ迄も追及する。私は驚いた。これが民主警察の調べ方だろうか、これでは民主的どころかおよそ逆である。これに較べれば昔の特高の調べ方の方がどの位楽だったか判らない。いかに有りのままを言っても、テンデ相手にしてはくれない。御自分の方の主張をあく迄通そうとする。これは大変な事だ。どう言っていいか私には判らない。私は調べられているんじゃない、命令されているんだ。正直に言う事それは将に命令違反でしかない。私は苦し紛れに作り事を言いましょうかと言うと、彼等は『そんな馬鹿な事はいかん。正直に言いさえすれはいいのだ』と言う。と言って正直に言えは全然取り合わない。およそ世の中にこんな矛盾撞着な話があるであろうか、嗚呼神よ、自分はどうすれはいいのだとただ溜息をつくばかりだ。一体こんな取調べ方はいつから始まったんだろうか、最初から罪人として扱い、罪人にしてしまうのがソ連のやり方という事をかつて聞いた事がある。しかし民主日本の今日の警察がそれと同じような事はある筈がないと思うが、今日の前の現実はそれではないか。そんな事を考える暇にも三人の怒号は耳が割れんばかりだ。そんな訳で私はよく覚えていないが、不得要領の陳述でともかくその日の取調べは終ったが、恐らく調書は杜撰極まるものであったであろう。 次の日も前日のごとく、三氏から同一の問題について調べられたが、前日と同様明確な供述は出来よう筈がないので取調べはサッパリ進捗しない。彼等は益々焦ら立ち攻めたてる。ある時は語気荒く、あるときは静かになるというように、鬼になったり仏になったり端倪すべからざるものがある。その時フト頭に浮んだのは、終戦後アメリカ指導の下に民主日本となるや、被告といえども罪が決定する迄は罪人扱いをしないという事を聞いていたが、現実はあまりにも違うではないか、ここは最初から罪人扱いだ。不肖私といえども信徒三十万から崇敬されている一宗の教組である。ところがどうだ。その扱い方は現行犯で引っ張られた刑事被告人と何等択ぶところはない。なるほど以前と違うところは言葉つきの些か丁寧になった事だ。「貴様」「お前」は使わない、ただそれだけである。私はこの時程昔の調べ方が恋しいと思った事はなかった。そうして今の取り調べ方で最も苦痛なのは、遮二無二記憶を呼び起せという記憶訊問である。なるほど自分が直接ふれた事か又は承認を与えた事なら、何とか記憶を呼び起せない事もないが、全然私の知らぬ間に部下が任意に行った事や、報告の際主要なるものは聞くようにしているが、忙しい時は聞き漏らしもあり、大抵な事は聞いてもすぐ忘れてしまうのである。 ここで私の性格と日常生前をかく必要があろう。私の性格は小さい事は人委せで、万事大局を掴んで事を処理するのである。それでなくては到底大規模な経営は出来るものではない。当時私は週刊新聞と月刊雑誌を発行し、編集は殆んど私一人でやっていた。まず記事の八、九割は私のかいたものと校正した投書や寄書である。その他単行本は一カ年教程を著述刊行していた。熱海及び箱根には百人以上の労務者を使役し、大規模な地上天国の模型を造らしている。言う迄もなく設計も様式も私一人が考案して指示していた。寸暇があれはお守や依頼された書体等一カ月数千枚はかくのである。信者の面会は月六回の休の外、毎日一時間ないし一時間年位数百人から、多い時は千人以上に及ぶ事さえある。それら信徒に対し質問応答並びに講話を聞かせるのである。又教団の幹部及び知名の士や有力者、新聞雑誌記者等、特殊の人達数人以上に面接している。時々東京へ行く事もあるがこれは一日掛りである。日刊新聞教種及び読みたい雑誌は目を通す事にしているが、私は老眼だから毎晩部下に読ませている。又私は若い頃から映画が非常に好きなので、信者は私を慰めるべく各会順繰に奉仕し、月に数回は別院の広間で映画の会を催すのである。勿論勤労奉仕者十人の慰安のためもある。又私はラジオは好きであり、出来るだけ聴くようにしているがラジオだけ聴く事はない。何かしら仕事をしながら聴くので二元的である。それ程私は時間を惜しむのである。ザットかいただけでこれ位であるからいかに多忙を極めているかが判るであろう。私は常に人にて十人前の仕事をしているというが、これはあえて誇張とは思わない。 このような私の多忙生活であるから、金銭上の事など全部部下に委せきりで、日にどの位の収入があるのか、どの位支出があるのか聞いた事もないのである。また私は生神様のごとく、信者から崇敬されている以上、金銭などに関心を持つなどはその必要がないのみか、反って品位を落す事にもなるから特に触れないようにしている。これはひとり私ばかりではあるまい。世間何宗といえどもその開祖教主たるものは金銭は勿論、俗事から超越しているのが通例である。このような訳で経済面やその他に関し時々大体の報告を聞く位で、金高の非常に多い場合とか、金銭以外特殊のものは参考として聞くだけで信仰以外の俗事には殆んど耳を傾けないようにしている。 それだのに何ぞや、私に対して調官の取調べは、宗教上に関する点は一言もなく、専ら経済に関するもののみである。したがっていかに記憶を呼び起せと言っても不可能である事は判りきった話である。調官といえどもそれを知らないはずはないと思うが、どこ迄も経済に関するもののみを執拗に繰返し追及するので、私はその真意を解するに苦しんだ。調官はこういうのでゐる『君は教団の総帥である以上金銭上の事についても知らない筈はない。第一それを知らないとすれば無責任極まるじゃないか』と攻めるから、私は『商事会社の社長ではないから、そんな事は答えられない。しかし仮に社長であっても、税金や会計上の事は専任の部下が責任をとる事になっていて、社長は責任を負わない事になっている』と聞いている。いわんや宗教の教主たるにおいてをやである。しかるに何ぞや教祖の私を掴えては経済面のみを執拗に訊問するのは前述の通りである。その都度私は、商事会社の社長とは違うから宗教上に関した事ならいかようにも答えるが経済面は無理であると言うと『そんな事はあるもんか、君は何でも部下に罪を被せようとする、実に卑怯だ。教祖たるものは部下の罪も引受けるのが当り前じゃないか』と言うのであるから開いた口が塞らない。これでは宗教家が警察官から御説教を聞かされる訳だ。私は彼等の余りの無理解に憤怒がこみあげてくるのを、彼等の感情を害しては損だと思い、又これも神の試錬とも解してじっと我慢し、虫を殺して平身低頭ひたすら御気嫌を損じないよう、これ努めた事は一再ならずであった。 Ｓ警部は二三日で帰ってしまった。後はＫ氏とＭ氏の両人が、自分の仕事の合間合間に根気よく取調べたのである。少ない時でも一日数時間に及んだであろう。いつも取調べを始める前、Ｍ氏は決まって一クサリのお説教をする。その言う事はいつも同じであるが、Ｍ氏は気がつかないらしい。それはこうである『君も一日も早く帰りてえだろうし、数人の部下も長い間牢屋に入っているし、早く出してやりてえだろうから、速かに記憶を呼び起して残らず話してしまった方がいいぜ』と言う。またこんな事を言った事もある。『こんな判りきった事件の記憶を呼び起せねえ筈はねえ、殺人強盗でさえ五年も前の事でもよく覚えていてスラスラ白状するのに、君のは僅か二年前の事なんだ、覚えがねえ訳はねえ、これじゃ神様か何か知らねえが、殺人強盗にも劣るじゃねえか」とこんな調子である。余りの侮辱に私は情なさに涙が込みあげて来るのをどうする事も出来なかった。その時私は思った。なるほど殺人強盗のような異常な行為は、五年前は愚か十年否一生忘れる事は出来まい、しかし私のは全然無根の事だから忘れるとか忘れないとかの問題ではない。彼はこんな判りきった事さえ判らないのか、判らない振りをするのかとにかく追及は益々烈しくなる。彼は度々こうも言った。「君が記憶を呼び起さなければ呼び起さないでもいいよ、僕の方はちっとも困りゃしねえからな、けれどそれじゃ君の方が損じゃねえか、だからまあ記憶を呼び起すまで幾日でもいて貰うんだな――早く記憶を呼び起してちっとでも早くここを出た方が利巧だよ、よく考え給え」とも言うのである。 記憶の捏造 これを聞かされる毎に私は気が気じゃない。どうしたらいいのだろう。全然ない記憶を呼び起せと言っても無理だし、呼び起さなければ幾日でも留置されるとしたら、何とかしなければならない。こんな苦しみをするくらいなら以前に何か少しくらい悪い事をしておけばよかった。そうすればそれを白状したら済むがなあとそんな事まで思った。私は考えに考えた末、ここに一つの方法を考え出した。それは記憶の捏造だ、つまり記憶を呼び起したらしく作為する事だ。これが彼の言う利巧というものだろう。そこで私は恐る恐るそうしてみた。彼は丸キリ違うと言って取合わない。また私は考えた。彼の言葉の端から幾分ずつでも嗅ぎ出して作ってみようと思い、色々引出そうとしたが彼は誘導訊問になるから駄目だと言う。仕方なしに私は彼の顔色を窺い窺い言葉の端に注意しながら僅かずつ作り上げ、曲りなりにも調書が出来たのである。その時私は世にも不思議な事を自分はするのだと思った。警察官の前で自分自身で無実の罪を作るべく苦心惨澹すると言うのだからだ。私はこんな不合理な事が文化国家に有り得るものだろうか、こんな変な骨の折れる事はかつて思ってみた事も聞いた事もない。彼は罪になりそうな陳述をすると満足そうであるが、そうでない陳述は仲々受入れようとしない。しかし私は罪を作るにしても手加減をした。まず一項目に一つか二つくらいなるべく罪が軽くて済むように作為して述べたのである。出てから弁護士に聞いてみると、素人の悲しさ作り方が実にまずいと言われたのである。私の調書をみればそうなっているからよく判るはずだ。また彼は常に語気荒くほとんど喋舌り続けで私には喋舌らせようとしない。これには実に困った。私が喋舌ろうとすると大声で打消してしまう。仕方なく私は彼の喋舌り続ける隙を窺っては僅かずつ陳述したのである。そんな事が数日間続いた。その頃Ｋという検事が出張して来て私を取調べた。ところがＫ検事はインテリ型でその訊問は穏やかで話がよく判り私は救われたような気がした。そのためスラスラ喋舌る事が出来たが、困った事には検事の訊問事項と警察官のそれと同一であるから、警察官に答えた事はその通り言わなければならない。しかしその時の私はもう嘘を言ってしまったんだからどうにでもなれという、半ば棄鉢気分も手伝ってある程度検事の気に入りそうに作為した事は言うまでもない。それから二、三日後応援検事と言うＹ氏が来て訊問されたが、これも大体警官に答えたと同様な陳述をした。Ｙ検事は仲々辛辣に突込んで来たが、どうやらこうやら辻棲を合せて曲りなりにも調書が出来たので私はホッとした。Ｙ検事は数日後再び来られ、取調べを受けたが、前同様であったのはもちろんである。 頭脳の拷問 ここで特筆すべき事が起った。それはＭ氏とＫ氏との両氏から調べられた時の事である。この時は主にＭ氏が訊問に当ったが、昭和二十三年十一月八日に始まった脱税問題に対する運動費の件が主であった。私は全然記憶にないから答える事が出来ないと言うと、Ｍ氏はどうしても承知しない。例の記憶を呼び起せを繰返すのである。彼は時々用事のため席を外すが少時にして戻り「まだ記憶を呼び起せねえか」と催促する。私は例のごとく捏造答弁をするが、何しろ数字の問題なので丸きり桁が違うとか、問題にならぬとか言っては撥ね返されてしまう。彼は言う、「こんな判り切った問題が記憶を呼び起せねえなんて事はあるもんか、正直に言えば何でもねえのに曲げて言おうとするから暇が掛かるんだ」などというので、私は腹が立って仕方がない。私は曲げたり嘘を言ったりする考えは毛頭ない。私も宗教家である以上、常に信徒に対（むか）って虚言を最も戒めているにみて、自分から嘘を言うはずがないではないか、第一神様に対しても虚偽りを言う事は出来ないと説明するが何の反響もない。丸で石地蔵に物を言ってるようなものだ。しかし彼は相変らず記憶を呼び起せの一点張りである。訊問が数字なので作為は実に困難だ。私は焦慮、煩悶、憤怒、絶望等の感情が交錯し、頭脳は困惑の極に達した。グラグラと周囲一面大きな渦巻となった。烈しい眩暈（めまい）が起り、視覚はなくなり、意識は朦朧として気が狂いそうだと思う一瞬、人事不省となってその場に昏倒してしまった。幸い一、二分にして気がついたが、烈しい眩量は耐えられない程で、嘔吐さえ催すのである。仕方なく彼らも取調べを止めた。一時間余経ってどうやら起上る事が出来たので、杖に縋ってようやく留置所内に辿り入る事が出来た。入るやその刹那、留置所が天国のように思えた。普通ならアノ窓の小さな、薄暗い鉄の牢屋格子が嵌められている留置所など想うさえゾッとするのに、それが天国に思えたのはいかに取調べが恐ろしかったかが判るであろう。すると数時間経った頃勾留後十日目の今日初めて弁護士が面会に来た。もっとも最初から接見禁止であったからである。私がフラフラしていて顔色が悪いのでたずねられたから、先刻昏倒した事など話すと、ともかく医師に診て貰いなさいと言うので私も承知した。間もなく警察医が来て診断を受けたが、脳神経衰弱との事であった。 ここで特に言いたい事は、勾留十日以上に及ぶと非常に衰弱するものである。何しろ食欲減退、運動不足、生活の激変、環境の不快感、取調べの苛烈による精神的苦悩等々、馴れないものは、誰しも極度の神経衰弱に陥ってしまうそうである。しかも私は数え年六十九歳の高齢であり、平素から不自由のない生活をしているので、弱り方も特にはなはだしいのである。 翌日、午後になって半分くらい快復した時、再び呼び出され、取調べを受けたがこの時は先方も加減したせいか、どうやら無事に済んだのである。ところがその翌日は一層恢復したので呼び出され訊問を受けたが、この時またまた一昨日の運動費の件が蒸し返された。私はまだ記憶は呼び起せないと言うと、彼らは承知せず相変らず記憶呼び起せの一点張りで責め立てる。余りの執拗さに私は憤怒、懊悩、焦慮などの感情が勃発しようとするのを一生懸命抑えつけようとした。すると苦悩困惑は頭の中でまた渦を巻き始めた。俄然一昨日通りの無意識となり昏倒してしまった。むしろ前回よりもひどかったくらいである。気がついてから身体が痺れたようで、立とうとするとどうしても立てない。一時間余経てようやく立つ事だけは出来たが歩行する事が出来ない。するとＭ氏は見兼ねて私を背負い、留置所内まで運んでくれたが、背負われながら私は思わず叫んだ、「これは頭脳の拷問だ」と言った。拷問の言葉に彼らはギョッとしたらしい。それ以来眩暈は一層はなはだしくなり、ちょっと何か考えようとするとグラグラとする、私は確かに頭脳のどこかが壊れたような気がする。これは大変だ、というのは、もし今一度例の運動費問題で攻められるとしたら、今度は完全に頭脳は破壊されてしまうだろう。その結果、発狂か痴呆症かどちらかは免れまい。あるいは一生涯廃人同様になるかも知れないという無気味な予感が襲って来て仕方がない。そこで翌日は取調べに呼び出されたが私は拒否したのである。と言ってグズグズしてもいられない。一刻も早く取調べが済まなければ出る事が出来ないからである。絶体絶命とはこれである。すると天の助けか浮び出たのが昔旺（さか）んに行った事のある交霊術である。そうだこれより外にこの難関を切抜ける手段はあり得ない。ところでこの難関の焦点は金銭の問題である。それは浅井哲夫氏がほとんど担当していたので同氏が詳しく知っているはずだ。だから同氏の霊を呼び寄せればいいと思い、夜の静寂を機としまず哲夫氏の霊を呼び出して試みてみた。このような霊術は昔から行者などがよくやる方法であるが、霊的智識の皆無な第三者には判りようがないので、認識させる事は絶対不可能である。しかしともかく霊から聞いてみると、スラスラと私の口から出てくるので、数字などもハッキリしたようだ。むしろ詳しすぎたくらいである。 刑務所行き その翌日例のごとく調べ室に呼ばれた。私は交霊術などと言っても、警察官などに判るはずはないから、色々考えた末こう言った。「実は昨夜絶体絶命の結果一心に神に祈った、すると御利益があって記憶がハッキリ浮び出し、判ったからお答えをする」と言ってスラスラ述べたのである。Ｋ氏もＭ氏も狐に撮（つま）まれたような顔をしていたが、ともかく私の陳述がいつもと違い淀みなく出るのでたちまち調書が出来上った。私は何が何でも訊問の苦しみから免れさえすればいい、ここを出さえすればいいと思い、鰐の口から逃れたような気がしてホッとしたのである。あたかもよしその晩Ｋ検事が出張して来て、いつものように取調べが初まった。私は警察官に述べたと同じようにスラスラと陳述したのでＫ検事は言った。「君は今まで辻棲の合わない事ばかり言っていたのに、急にハッキリしたのは可笑しいじゃないか」と色々訊かれた。なるほど私が今まで述べた運動費の額は五、六十万円と言ったり百万円くらいと言ったり、二百万円以上と言ったり全く出鱈目であったからで、これによってみても全然知らなかった事が判るであろう。それで私は到底理解させる事は困難だと思ったから、神に祈って奇蹟が現れたと答えたのである。これで取調べも一段落となったらしいので私も一安心し、ともかく頭脳の破壊だけは免れ得たと久し振りでその夜は熟睡出来たのである。ところが翌日となるや午前十時頃留置室の外からすぐ出なさいと言う声がした。取調べがすんだので今日釈放されるのかと早合点し、やれ嬉しやと思ったところ、扉が開いて外へ出ると見馴れない警官が立っている。変だなと思うと彼は「これから静岡へ行くんだから仕度をしなさい」と言うので、私は二度吃驚した。留置所係の警官も手伝って毛布を初め身の廻りのもの、持てるだけ持って二人の警官と同行自動車に乗った。約一時間くらいで車が停ったので、みると刑務所の門前ではないか、私はハッとした、マサカ刑務所へ入れられようとは夢にも思わなかったからである。刑務所、刑務所、嗚呼何という恐ろしい忌わしい名ではないか、私は生涯の内刑務所など入れられるような事は絶対ないと信じ切っていた。この時平重盛の有名なアノ言葉を思い出さずにはおられなかった。「昨日は人の身の上と思いしに、今日は我が身に振りかからんとは」その通りだ。一体私は刑務所へ入れられるようなどんな悪い事をしたのであろうか、どうも判らない。疑問がまた一つ増えたと思った。事によると昨夜交霊術によって余りにハッキリ陳述したので、それが法に触れたのではあるまいか、刑務所入りはそのためかとも想像してみたが、そうでなかった事は後で弁護士から聞いて判った。それから型のごとく諸般の手続きを済ませ、警官の案内で、無気味な刑務所の建物の間を通り抜け、一丁程歩くと新しく出来た到底刑務所などとは想えない、モダンな建物の中に連れられ独居の一室に入れられたのである。みると狭いが便所もあり、小さな炊事場もあり、水道も備わっていて、壁は白く窓は大きくて明るく実に気持がよい。真っ暗なジメジメした警察の留置所などとは及びもつかない清潔さで牢獄にいるような気などしない。私は救われた思いである。窓の外を見れば庭型の広場があり、囚人の作ったらしい紫陽花の花さえ咲きかけている。高い厳しい煉瓦（れんが）塀に囲われはしているが、塀上の青空をくっきり描いている新緑滴る五、六本の大きな樹木さえ見えるではないか、間もなく官給の昼飯が来たのでみると驚いた。昔からよく言う物相飯（もっそうめし）とはこれなんだ。麦七分米三分くらいで大きなニュームの椀に盛られている。菜と言えば小さな梅干がタッタ二個きりだ。まず飯を口へ入れてみると、勿体ないが喉へ通りそうもない。すると囚人である弁当配布係が来て「差入がありますから官給弁当はお止しなさい」と言うので止めたが、この時の差入弁当の美味さは、今なお忘れられない味だった。ここへ来て全く別世界へ来たような感がした。 ところが私は前夜Ｋ検事に答えた霊憑り陳述が気になり初めた。というのは元来交霊術というのは生霊を呼んで聞くのだから正確とは言えない。自己意識が混じったり、狐霊の悪戯などもあったりして随分誤りもあるので十数年前止めたくらいである。いわんや昨夜のそれは苦し紛れの産物であるから、どうも自信がもてない。もしか間違った点があるとしたら大変だから、その訳を言って取消して貰わなければならないと囚人係の部長にＫ検事に面会を求めたのが刑務所へ入った翌朝であった。その返事には午後面会するというので待っていたがその日は駄目で、その翌日も頼んだがやはり駄目だった。その日Ｍ弁護士が面会に来たので右の話をして相談してみたところ、弁護士はやはりその事を思った通り言った方がよいと言うのである。私は弁護士に対（むか）っても、霊憑り陳述であるから正確とは言えない。苦し紛れの作り事でいわば推理小説のようなものだと言った。ところがその翌六月十八日刑務所へ来てから四日目であった。夜になってやっと調べ室へ呼び出されたが、ここへ来てから初めての取調べである。ところがこの時一生忘れる事の出来ない一大ショックに出遭った。まず調べ室に入りＫ検事に対い合って椅子にかけるや、イキナリＫ検事は立ち上がり、顔面蒼白、眼はすわり震えながら私に対って大喝一声「君くらい怪しからん人間はない。この間の最後の取調べは推理小説だと言うのか。（ハハア弁護士から聞いたなと思った）僕は真面目に調書を作ったんだよ、君の記憶がハッキリしたので立派な陳述が出来たと思って書いたんだ、それに何ぞや推理小説などとは、検事を侮辱するにも程がある、僕は赦す事は出来ない」と眼光鋭く睨みつけ、噛みつかんばかりの気勢である。私は青天の霹靂どころではない。百雷の一時に落ちたごとくに縮み上がって声さえ出ない。こんなに感情を害してしまった以上、法律知識のない私はどんなことになるか判らないという恐怖で、身体は石のごとく、自己存在の意識すらない。ただ平蜘蛛のようにヘタバッテ一心に謝罪するばかりだ。洵（まこと）に申訳ありません、何卒お許し下さい。私は馬鹿でしたというような言葉を何編も繰り返しつつ、滂沱（ぼうだ）として流るる涙をどうする事も出来なかった、その時検事はこういう事も言った。「君の教団を潰そうと思えば余計な手数は要らない、僕一人の力で一日で潰してしまえるんだよ」。この言葉を聞いて私は愕然とした。私はこう思った。信教の自由を保証されている今日、仮にも三十万の信徒を擁する宗教が、一人の検事の力で一日で潰されるとしたら、宗教なるものの何たる脆弱さであろう。新宗教のナンバーワンなどと言われていい気になっておさまっていた自分は、実は噴火山上で昼寝していたようなものだ。これは大いに考えなくてはならない重大事だと思った。この事も私が救世教教主を退めた動機の一つでもあった。加えるに前述のごとく頭脳が大いに痛められ、今後教主の責任をつくす事は困難と思ったからでもある。私が涙を流しての平あやまりに流石の検事も幾分平静を取戻したらしく、普通の取調べになったようだが、それでもいつもと違い、皮肉タップリでともすれば絡んでくる。ハラハラしながらどうやら答えたが、確かこの時は調書も出来ずに終ったような気がする。この時の調べが済んだ直後、私はこういう事を思った。恐らく私が物心ついて五十有余年、この時程一箇の人間に対し、平身低頭最大級の謝罪の言葉を絞り出し、あやまった事は、いまだかつてなかった。また私は何十年来、涙など流した事もなかったが、この時ばかりは止めどもなく涙が溢れてしようがなかった。一体俺はどんな悪い事をしたんだろう、どうしても判らない。ただ経済面の事は、部下に委せてあったため、私の知らなかった事を、知らなかったと言ったまでで、結局部下の罪を私は被せられたのだ。世間社長の罪を社員が被る事は聞いていたが、社員の罪を社長が、被せられる事は聞いた事がない。しかし部下としても、教団のためと思ってやった事で、悪意からでないには違いないが、と言って部下の過ちは、首脳者が責任を負うという理屈はないばかりか、私の場合は世間一般の人達とは大いに違う。私は宗教家であり、一宗の教祖である。私は神の代行者と信じている。従って神の意志を伝え教えを説くのが私の本領である。この意味において私は俗事の外に超然としているべきであると思っている。従って経済面特に金銭等に関してはただ聞くだけですぐ忘れてしまう。私はそれでよいと思っている。これはひとり私ばかりではあるまい。昔から今に到るまでいかなる宗教の開祖教祖といえども、恐らく金銭上の事にまで関心をもつ者は一人もあるまい。むしろ俗事に離れれば離れる程、真の宗教家の在り方である事は、社会の通有観念である。検察官といえどもそれを知らないはずはあるまい。私はこう考えてくるといよいよ判らなくなる。御承知のごとく新憲法においても信教の自由を認めている。というのは国策上信仰の尊き使命を認識しているからであろう。また飜（ひるがえ）って観る時、昔から一宗の開祖教祖が法難に遭った例は数多くあるが、経済問題で法難に遭った者は恐らくないであろう。 前述のごとくであるから、私といえども宗教以外の容疑に対しては、満足な答弁が出来るはずがないではないか、しかも頭脳の拷問に等しき峻烈な取調べのため、二回まで卒倒したにみて、この恐るべき取調べを避けなければ、頭脳の破壊は免れないと思い、やむなく窮余の一策として神憑的手段に出て、ともかく安全を得たのであるから、私のした事は頭脳擁護のためで、一点の疚しいところはない訳である。とは言うものの、仮にも本当らしく虚言を述べたので、早速訂正したいと思い、弁護士を通じて私の意志を伝えたのである。 以上のごとき経路をよく考えてみると、私のどこに間違った点があるのであろうか、こんなにまで怒られ、怒鳴られ、侮辱を浴びせられ涙まで流して陳謝しなければならないという理由は、何としても発見出来ないのである。今日人権と言う言葉があるが、そんなものはどこにあるのか、これが民主日本であり、文化国家の役人であるとは、どうしても受けとれない。公務員は人民の公僕などと言われるが飛んでもない話だ。ここでは人民は公務員の奴隷でしかないと、私は慨嘆せずにはおれなかったのである。 翌十九日午後再び呼び出され、いつもの通り取調べが始まったが、これはまた意外である。昨夜とは打って変った穏やかさで、私は狐に撮（つま）まれたような気がした。さては今日逮捕されたと聞いた浅井氏から私が贈賄問題とは、何ら関係のない事を、証言したためではなかろうかと想像してもみた。そんな具合でこの時は無理な訊問はなく、言わば派生的なものばかりであったから、スラスラ陳述する事が出来たのである。検事は急用が出来たので「後は晩にしよう」といって室外へ出て行った。その夜九時頃再び呼ばれ、若干の残りの事項を訊かれたが、これも簡単に済んで、調書は大体出来上ったようである。するとイキナリ検事は「君はもう帰ってもいいよ」と言う。私は余りの意外に急には呑み込めず、しばらくまごついたがようやく釈放された事を意識し、十一時頃出所したのである。 カマを掛ける 取調べの場合、カマを掛けるという言葉は昔からよく言われるが、今度の取調べに際しこのカマを掛けられた事実は非常に多く、ほとんど取調べの骨子となっていたと言ってもいい。近来の取調べ方針は誘導訊問を最も嫌っているようだが、しかし誘導訊問よりカマ掛け訊問の方がどのくらい悪質であるか分らない。何となれば誘導訊問の方が取調べの場合嘘が少ないからである。誘導訊問は言葉の技巧であるに比し、カマ掛け訊問の方はほとんど捏造的虚言であって、嘘を本当らしい巧妙な言い廻しで引っ掛けようとする。ゆえに正直な人や経験のない者はうっかり乗ってしまうので、彼らは大いにこの手を用いるのである。もし引っ掛からないとすれば、その人は百も承知の経験者である。経験者とは前科者という訳だから、初犯者は引っ掛り、前科者は巧く逃げるという結果になるから、善人は罪人となり、悪人は無罪となるという訳だ。その何よりの証拠は今回の事件で吾々全部が、このカマ掛け訊問に引っ掛ったのが原因で起訴にまでなったのをみて明らかである。まずその一例をかいてみよう。 今度帰宅後容疑者の一人である私の秘書井上福夫から聞いた話であるが、彼は平素私の仕事に忠実で、二十年間も奉仕していたのだから、彼の性格も行状も判りすぎるくらい判っている。絶対悪人ではない。多くの人の批評によるも「世にも珍しい善人だ。仏様のようだ」と常に言われている。たまには私が叱責する事もあるが、そういう時いつも私は彼に対（むか）って「君は人が善すぎるから困る」というくらいである。彼は実に柔順で人の言いなり放題になり、怒ったり、逆らったり、反対するなどは出来ない性格である。そういう彼が今度カマ掛け訊問に掛ったんだから堪らない。それにはお誂え向きの人間である。彼は記憶にない事はないと何程言ってもテンデ調官は相手にせず、毎日毎日攻められるので、極度の神経衰弱となり、果ては全身的健康さえ損なわれ、この分では生命も危ぶまれそうな心配が湧いて来たので、これは大変と思い、一日も早くここを出して貰わなければならないと何でも言いなり放題に是認したそうである。そんな訳で毎回の答弁は支離滅裂で、調官も非常に困ったそうである。井上のごとき善人を調べるのは、赤児の手を捻じるようなもので、全く善人程可哀相なのはないと思った。 こういう事もあった。私が取調べを受けた際、調官はよく言う事に「今度の事件は僕の方では半年も前から充分調べ抜いたのであるから、今更隠したって何にもならないよ。何でも晒け出して言ってしまった方が君の得だよ」と言うのであるが、取調べ事項を聞いてみる毎に、余りの見当違いに驚いたのである。というのは、ほとんど調べが出来ていないような事項が、余りに多くあったからである。何よりも武装警官八十人も動員したというにみて、いかに調査が届いていなかったかが判るので、もし充分調べがついていたら、そんなに大袈裟な事をする必要はなく、簡単な取調べで済んだはずである。その時私はこうも思った。多勢のスパイを使い信者に化けさせて、徹底的に調べたら一番よかった。そうすれば余りに意外な立派な宗教に驚いて調べるどころか、むしろ国家が大いに支援したくなるくらいだと、思わずにはおれないからである。右のごとくであるからなるほど調べるには調べたであろうが、浅い調べ方であったに違いない。ゆえに充分調査したと言う事は、一種のカマ掛け訊問にすぎないのである。 前述のごとくカマ掛け訊問によって、善人が引っ掛り罪人にされるとしたら、容易ならぬ問題と思った。このような取調べ方法が、唯一のものとされている現行検察制度としたら、人民は迷惑するばかりである。公明正大であるべき司法行政圏内に、右のごとき非民主的の暗雲がありとすれば、一日も速かに払拭して、明朗鏡のごとき法の世界たらしめん事を、望んでやまないものである。 帰 宅 後 ここで、帰宅後の事も一通りかかねばならないが、帰宅後某弁護士に面会、色々取調べの模様を話したところ、その弁護士が言うには「それは惜しい事をしましたね。被告には黙秘権があるんだから、記憶にない事は答弁しなくてもよかったので、黙っていてもそのために不利益を受けないことは、法律上定まっているんですよ。従って今度の貴方の場合お話のように、苦しむ必要はなかったので、知らない事は知らないと主張すればよかったのですよ。作り事を言ったため反って法に引掛ったのだから実に残念でしたね」と言われ、私も吃驚したが、よく考えてみるとそういう法律など知らなかったためで、今更悔んだとてどうにもならないのである。実に今日の社会生活上法律に無知なるため、思わざる災害を被る人も世間には、すくなからずあるであろうから、たとえ宗教人といえども、一通りの法律は心得ておかなければならないと、思わざるを得なかったのである。ところがそれだけではない。今度の私の場合などは、頭脳破壊の一歩手前まで責められ、今もって脳神経衰弱は治らず、極度の眩暈に苦しんでおり、忘れてしまった事も多いので困っている。外出も思うように出来ず、自動車へ長く乗る事も、出来ない有様である。私は短歌を作るのが好きだが、作歌は相当考えなくては、ならないので、これもまだ駄目である。この原稿もやっとの思いでかき上げたが、これは考える必要がなく、最近の経験を有りのまま書くだけだから、左程困難ではなかったからである。 出所後、十数日経って、今一度取調べたいと、Ｋ検事から弁護士を通じて申し来ったので、私はまだ病気が全快しない理由で、二人の医師の診断書を添え、自宅訊問を懇願したが許されなかったので、先方のいう通り当時在住の箱根強羅から直接三島所在の検察署〔庁〕へ赴くのはまだ無理なので、一旦熱海の自宅へ行き一泊したるところ、その翌日検事も同情されたと見え、熱海市所在の検察庁支所まで出張されたから私も近いため出向いたのである。その時の訊問は警察及び刑務所で、度々取調べられた事項の繰返しである。検事は今まで申立てた事は、間違いないか――と訊くので、私はもうこの機会に真実の事を言ってもいいと思ったから、それを言いかけると、Ｋ検事は非常に立腹し「今更前言を覆されては困る。もし君がタッテそうしようとするなら、新規蒔直しに、最初から取調べるがどうだ――」と言われたので、私は吃驚した。何しろ健康も碌々（ろくろく）恢復していないのにまたまた厳しい記憶訊問をされたら大変だ。せっかく治りかけた頭脳を再壊される危険がないとは言えないと思ったので、止むなく検事の希望通り答弁してしまった。それで検事の御気嫌もよく事なく済んだが、帰宅後その通り弁護士に話したところ「それは惜しい事をしましたね――今日のは最後の駄目押しなんだから、今までの間違った陳述を訂正するには、最もよい機会だったんですよ。真実一点張りで頑張れば不起訴になったかも知れない」と言われ、私も取返しのつかない事をしてしまったと悔んだのである。元来、私は人の言う事に反対する事の出来ない性分で、いつも人の言う事をきいてしまうという人並はずれた気の弱さがあり、自分自身に腹を立てる事さえしばしばあるのである。またその時弁護士は検事の様子はどうでしたかと訊くから、「私は初めは変だったが、最後は大分御気嫌が直ったようですよ」と言うと、彼は「それはそうでしょう。御注文通り起訴の理由が出来たからですよ」と言われた。これについて以前私は武者小路実篤氏の小説にあった警句を思い出した。それは「彼は神のごとく弱く、神のごとく強し」という言葉で、非常に面白いと感銘した。ちょうどこの言葉は今の私によく当はまる。すなわち彼という字を、岡田に置き換えればその通りだ。全くこの時の私は神のごとく弱しであったが、しかし私には神のごとく強しと言う一面もある。それは不正を憎み、悪と闘い勝たねば措かぬと言う強さである。 帰宅後、判った事であるが、本教の大幹部渋井総三郎氏が私が出所の日、入替りに勾留されたというので驚いた。種々聞くところによれば、刑務所内から数丁離れた検察局へ取調べのため、数回通わせられた事があったが、その際人通り繁き往来を、編笠を被り、手錠をはめられたまま連行されたというのであるから、いかに厳重な扱いを受けたかが解るのである。そうして同氏は六十余歳の老齢であり、しかも一昨年三回目の脳溢血で倒れたので、医学上から言っても脳溢血は二回目でさえ、生命の危険があるのに、三回目となっては、万に一つも助からないと言うのが定説である。ところが三回目の脳溢血が発った時、私の浄霊によって、ともかく生命は取止め、現在相当よくなってはいるが、いまだ真の全快までには、到っていないので、すべての任務は代行者に委せているくらいで、頭脳を使うのはまだ無理であり、検察官の取調べのごときは不可能である。しかるにそのような実状を知ってか、知らないでか前述のごとく、重罪犯人扱いをするのであるから解し難いのである。本人としても逃走の憂いなく、抵抗の危険等も絶対あり得ない事は常識で考えても判るのみならず、氏は教団の最高幹部として多くの信徒から尊敬されており、しかも氏の頭脳は前述の通りである。とすれば、十数日間刑務所に勾留し、毎日のごとく訊問を続けたという事は、どう考えても無理どころか、むしろ残酷とさえ思えるのである。無論調書なども正確なるものは、出来ようはずはない。そのような半病人が、右のごとき扱いを受けたのであるから、気の毒というより外はない。私が出所の日「渋井はまだ頭がボンヤリしているねえ」と検事は言ったくらいだから、検事も知っている訳である。渋井氏出所後の話によれば、いくら訊問を受けても、全然忘れている事が多いので「自分は頭がボンヤリしていてよく判らないから、そちらでよろしいように書いてくれろ」と言ったら、調官は大喝「この馬鹿野郎」と言ったそうである。一体これでよいのであろうか。私にはサッパリ判らない。 私は、これらに対していささかも批判を加えようとは思わない。ただ聞いたまま、あるがままを記録としてかいたので、批判は読む人に委せるのみだ。ただ私の問いたい事は、なぜにこのように常識では考えられない程な、無慈悲極まるやり方をするかという事である。そうして今度の事件について多くの人の見解が一致してる点は、大袈裟な家宅捜索をしたにかかわらず、骨折損の草疲〔臥〕儲けに終ったので、面目上何らか相当な罪人を出さなければならない羽目になったので、大いに焦り、取調べに無理が出来たのではないかというのである。今一つこういう事を言う人もあった。それは「救世教くらい世間に知れわたった宗教を槍玉にあげ、巧く成功するとしたら、大いに手柄になり、出世の糸口ともなるから一生懸命罪を掘出そうとして、必要以上の苛酷なやり方をしたんですよ。しかしこれはひとり救世教のみではなく、今までにも、こういう事はよくあった例ですよ」との事であったが、私は右のいずれも「そんな馬鹿な事があるはずはない ――と否定してしまった事もあった。その他今回の取調べ方を仔細に検討してみる時、余りに諒解に苦しむ点が多すぎるのである。まず第一不必要と思う程微に入り細にわたって訊問する。例えば誰それにやった金は、誰に命じて、誰の手から、何円札の束で渡したかとか、その日の何時頃どの部屋で渡したかとか、何んと言って渡したとか、その部屋には誰がいたかいなかったかと言うような事まで、繰返し繰返しほとんど同一の事を毎日のように訊くのである。なるほど記憶を呼び起すためにはそういうやり方も多少の効果はないではなかろうが、普通人としてそのような細かい事を二年も三年も経ってから訊かれてもハッキリ記憶している人は、恐らくないであろう。また事件の性質が刑事傷害等に関するものなればともかく、それ程の悪質のものでない事は、検察官なら充分判るはずである。私の経験によれば、特高時代三日くらいで調べ終るような事柄が、今日の調べ方では三十日掛ってもむずかしいであろう。これがため取調べ能率の低下は非常なもので、これらも改善の余地が大いにあると思うのである。 今一つ言いたい事は、今日の検察官が宗教について、余りに理解のない事である。この無理解は何よりも宗教人に対し、いささかの尊敬心もなく、一般人と同様に扱う事で、徳川時代でさえ僧侶は普通人より尊敬されていたそうである。私は警察官からこういう事を言われた。「君は家にいれば神様扱いをされ、みんなが頭を下げ、大切にするか知れないが、ここへ来ちゃ駄目だよ、ここじゃ君だって――スリや泥棒と同じ人間として扱うんだからなあ――その積りで居給え、それが公平なんだから仕方がないよ」との暴言には、私は唖然としたのである。 今一つ言いたい事は、今日の米国の繁栄である。その原因が那辺（なへん）にあるかを、充分検討すべき必要があろう。言うまでもなく同国の一般国民思想はキリスト教が根幹をなしており、それがあらゆる面に表われている。先日彼のマ元帥が、朝鮮問題に対して発表された宣言中にあった「神は吾らの目的を助けるであろう」との一言は、同元帥の信仰がいかに深いかを物語っている。またト大統領初め米国の有識階級はほとんどキリスト教信者という事で、米国の家庭には聖書のない家はほとんど一軒もないとの事であるにみても、同国の民主主義は全くキリスト教精神の現れでなくて何であろう。ところが現在の日本はどうであろうか、今度つくづく思われた事は、検察官の無信仰振りである。それかあらぬか余りに冷酷で、慈悲や情などなさすぎるように思われるのは、私ばかりではあるまい。今回の取調べの際も信仰について語りたいと思っても、全然興味をもっていないので、私は信仰談を中途でやめた事もあった。もちろん検察官本来の目的は罪人を作るに非ず、罪人を無くするにある事は言うまでもないが、事実はその逆でさえあると思えるのである。私は今回の事件で、大いに感じた事はどうしても罪人を扱う者は、宗教観念が根本になくては改過遷善（かいかせんぜん）の実は挙げ得ないと思った。 そうして、吾々宗教人を遇する場合、彼らは普通人同様というよりも、むしろそれ以下にみているとしか思えない程である。察するに彼らの心情は宗教などとは無用の長物と思っているらしい。中には憎悪の念さえ抱いているかのように見える者さえある。こういう事があった。私の部下の一人が、今度の事件で引っ張られ、数人の合部屋へ三十余日拘禁されたが、入獄中毎日毎日苛酷な取調べを合部屋の者に話したところ、前科何犯という強盗、傷害の囚人が驚いて言うには「俺達でもそんなヒドイ取調べを続けられた事はいまだかつてなかった、そういうヒドイ取調べは一日か二日だけで、後は普通だ」と言っていたそうである。これらによってみても、宗教人はいかに軽蔑されているかが判るのである。しかし当局者のみを咎（とが）めるのは当らないかも知れない。何となれば宗教を看板にして随分詐偽やインチキを行う輩も、世間すくなからずあるからである。従って今回の事件に鑑（かんが）み、吾々といえども大いに世の信頼をかち得べく自省しなければならない事を痛感したのはもちろんである。この意味において、神は吾らの覚醒を促すべく、今回のごとき尊き試練を与え給うたとも解されるのである。

# Crônica das Flores (kanren_hikari02)

**Category:** kanren | **Year:** - | **Source:** -

――― 関 連 出 版 物 ――― 光は大地に 麻生 鋭 2 花 だ よ り （一） チラホラと桜がさいてきた。暖地からの花便りが、人のこころをうきうきさせていた。 日曜なので、私は寝坊をした。夢うつつに玄関の鈴が鳴ったように思ったが、気がついてみると、隣り町に住む山本という風来坊が、枕元に立っていた。つぎの当ったズボンをはいて、相変らず頭はモジャモジャと雀の巣のようだ。 私が顔を洗って座敷へもどってくると、山本は机の上の『信仰雑話』を指さして、 「この岡田という教祖に会ったかい？」と、ニヤニヤして言った。 「うん」と、私は真面目に答えた。 「背中から煙が立ち昇っていたかい？」 「ただの人間だよ。いや、最も人間らしい人間だと言った方がよさそうだ」 「どんなことを言った？」 「僕は岡田という人が、今日までどんな修行をしたかをきいてみたんだ。すると、教祖はこう言うんだ。わしは山へ入って滝にうたれたこともなければ、木の股の上でただの一日も坐禅したことはない。わしの修行と言えば、借金苦を我慢することだった、とね」 「なるほど」と、山本は膝を乗り出した。 「そして、こうも言った。もともと自分は性格的にも怒ることは避けたい人間だが、不思議なほど怒りたくなる原因にぶつかる。これは神がわしという男を鍛え上げようとしてそうするのだということに気がついたのは、わしの髪に白いものが出て来てからのことだよ、とそう言って教祖は頭をかいた」 「おれも怒りっぽいから、怒る人間は好きだよ」 「随分ひどい誤解を受けて、参ったこともあるらしい。これがもし真実ならば、わしという人間の全部を抹殺されても仕方がないくらいの誤解だったと、教祖は言っていた。我慢しようと思っても、どうしても我慢出来ない。やり切れなくて、酒飲んで紛らせようとしたそうだ」 「大いに宜しい。酒は涙か溜息か、酒が一番いい。どんな苦労も忘れさせてくれる」と、山本ははしゃいで言った。 「酒の話というと君はすぐ相好を崩す、みっともないぞ」と、私はたしなめるように言った。しかし自分の言葉に勿体ぶった調子がある事に気がつき、私は茶の間の押入からウイスキーの角びんを出して来て、山本の前にデンと置いた。 「ますます宜しい。岩戸神楽の初めから、宗教に酒はつきものだ」 そう言って、山本は角びんの蓋をあけて、グラスに注いだ。 私は話を続けた。 「しかし、教祖はこう言うんだよ。何もかもしゃくにさわって仕方なかったが、ともかくわしはその怒りを押えた。じっとこらえた。ところが、その後になって、そういう大きな誤解がつまり神の恵みということがわかったと言うんだ。これは神などというものを考えなくても、修行ばなしとして聞いてもいい話だよ」 （二） 「というと、それはどういうことなんだい」と、山本がきき返して来た。 「要するにだね、その時のひどい怒りを押えたればこそ、次に来た一層ひどい災難にも堪えられたというのだよ。そうでなかったら、柔かい土に鍬をうち込むようなもので、自分という人間は、ひとたまりもなくヘタヘタとなってしまったというんだ」 「すると、怒る原因を与えるのも神の恵みなら、それを我慢する力を養わせるのも神の恵みということになるのか」 「そうだろうな」 「じゃあ、怒れないじゃないか」と、山本は怒れなくてはつまらないというような顔付をした。 「怒ろうと思って怒るのがＣクラス、怒ろうと思っても我慢するのが、Ｂクラス、怒ろうにも怒れなくなるのがＡクラス――こう言ったらわかるだろう」と、私も口から出まかせを言った。 「よせやい、そんなのは真っ平だ。おれは怒る時は怒る」 「それも自由だ。しかし、借金でギューギュー言わされている時、一体誰に怒ったら気が晴れるんだ」 「金貸しよ」 「なるほどね。だが、その金貸しに、貸して下さいと頼んだのは誰なんだ」 「おれだよ」 「それみたまえ。どうぞ貸して下さいと頭を下げて、その借りた金が払えないからって、貸し主に怒るのは少しへんだよ」 「理屈を言うな。酒がまずくなる」 「それそれ、それがいけないんだ。君こそ理屈を言い出したじゃないか。怒る時に怒れないような人生はつまらないと言ったが、あれは理屈ではないのか」 「理屈じゃない」 「そうか。それなら結構だが、君は幾度も女に瞞されていて、どうして笑っているのかね。君を裏切るような女はたたき殺したらいいじゃないか」 「瞞されても、ごまかされても怒れないんだ」 「よろしい。大いによろしい。君こそＡクラスのピカピカ人間だよ」 そう言いながら、私はまぶたの裏がジーンと熱くなって来るのを感じた。涙がにじみ出そうになった。 そこで、わざと教祖の声色を真似て、こんなせりふを言ってみた。 「借金のふえていく原因は、徒らに焦るためだぞ。焦るから、どうしても無理をする。何事も無理が最もいけない。無理をすれば、損をするにきまっている。損をするのは、欲張るからだ」 「そうすると、おれに金の出来ないのは、欲張るからかな」と、山本は鼻の頭を赤くして言った。 「自分で欲張りだと知っているなら、えらいものだ。教祖なども金が欲しい欲しいと焦っている時には、さっぱり金が入って来なかったが、勝手にしろと諦めてしまったら、金の方から土産物を下げて訪ねて来るようになったと笑っていた」 「よし、おれも金のことなんか忘れることにする。というのは、金に土産物下げて来て貰いたいからよ」と、山本は楽しそうに言った。 （三） しかし、山本は急に真顔になって、こう言うのであった。 「金の欲しくない人間はない。人間は、金、金、金で生きているようなものだ。だが、メシヤ教を信ずれば金が出来るというのは、なんだか卑しい感じがするよ。宗教というものは、精神的の救いが目的なのじゃないのかね。おれは神様のことなんか考えたこともないが」 「いや、実は僕も、前にはそう思っていたのだ」と、私は言った。 「前には確かにそう思っていたのだが、しかし今は、必ずしもそうは考えない。というのは、目の前にころがって来る御利益――現当利益というやつだが、そういう富くじみたいな宗教は低級だと言う人があるが、これは少しおかしいと考え直すようになったのだ。誰だって現当利益を欲しがらない者がいるかね。例外なくみんな仕合せになりたがっている。病気なら治りたい。貧乏なら金持になりたい。これは人間として最も当り前の欲望だ。君の言う通りだ。そういう欲望が、一つの宗教を信ずることによってかなえられるということは、有難く嬉しい考え方じゃないか。よく生悟りの宗教家が死生一如なんてことを簡単に言うけれども、死ぬことと生きることとは、全然違う。少くとも僕は、生死を超越しているなんていう人間は、一応も二応も疑ってみるね」 「それは、おれも大賛成だ。大体、超越なんて言葉を無闇に使いたがるやつは怪しいよ」と、山本は相槌を打って来た。 「だから、教祖は、そんな勿体ぶったことは言わない。自分は宗教家でもあるが、宗教業者でもあるって、こういうことは中々言えないものだ」 「うん、その言葉も気に入ったよ」と、山本はグラスをあけた。 私は続けた。 「そして、こうも言っている。自分の弟子は何千人とあるが、それがみんな霊力で病気を治すことが出来るのだから、言うならば自分は神様製造業者だ。――愉快な教祖じゃないか」 「なるほどな。おれはどんな宗教も嫌いだが、そういう話を聞くと、ちょっとお光様に敬意を表したくなる」 「宗教家の宗教臭いのは、まだ本物になっていないからだと思う。その点、教祖は淡々として水の如し……ってところがある。ザックバランで、あけすけで、自分は宗教のことなんかよくは知らんよというような顔をしている」 「じゃ、あんまりうるさいことは言わないだろうな」と、山本は念を押すように言って、「おれは御札でバリケードを築いているような宗教は大嫌いだからな」とつけ加えた。 「うるさいことはなにも言わない。一体、禁欲生活をしなければ名僧にも知識にもなれないように思うのは間違っている。――そう教祖は言っている」 「おれも青年時代に、キリスト教会へ行ったことがあるんだが、色情をもって女を見る者は云々のところで落第さ。おれみたいな人間の入れる教えじゃないと思ったよ」 （四） 「色情をもって女を見る者は、心のうちで既に姦淫したものだなんて、こいつはおれみたいな多情な男の到底守れる道徳じゃない。二、三回通っただけでやめてしまった」 そう言って、山本は面白そうに笑った。 「メシヤ教では言っている。春の花も秋の月も、芸術も文学も、みんな神が人間を楽しませるために造ったものだ。うまい食べ物もキレイな着物も、ただ必要だけで存在しているのではない。舌や目を楽しませるためだ。それを我れから拒否して、女人のめでたさをも感じまいとする――そういう禁欲的人生は、却って深い神の恩恵にそむくものだ。そう教祖は言っている。美しいものは、実に数限りなくあるし、それを見たり聞いたりして楽しむ心を神が与えてくれている以上、禁欲生活をして、見まい聞くまい楽しむまいとするのは、明らかに神への背反的行為だと、僕も思うよ」 「そいつは、おれも賛成だ。酒はいけない、煙草もいけない、栄華や芝居もいけないなんていう宗教は、うそつきや偽善者を見るようでどうもおれには向かない」 「おや、君にも向く宗教があったのかい？」と私は突込んだ。 「こいつは失言だ。そういう意味じゃないんだ。おれは無神論者だが、どうせ信ずるなら、酒のんで、笛吹いて、現在を楽しむような明るい宗教の方に軍配を上げるという意味なんだ」 そこで私は、メシヤ教の映画会の話をした。 「熱海の本部では、一日置きに映画会をやっているよ。僕もこのあいだ観せて貰ったがね。教祖と奥さんとが一番前に仲よく並んで観ていた。西部劇だったよ。その映画はくだらないものだったが、一宗の教祖がみんなを集めて、一晩おきに映画を観て楽しむというところが気に入ったね。チャンバラでも甘い恋愛物でも、映画会社から取り寄せて映している。大きな観音の軸のかけてある広間の一方に白い幕を張って、君の名は？ 真知子ですわ……なんていうメロドラマを観るのは愉快だと思ったよ」 「なかなか話せる」 そう言って、山本はちょっと寂しい表情をした。 私は、本当は信じたいのだが信ずることの出来ない人間の悲しみを、山本のその表情に見たと思ったので、 「疑いは信仰のはじめだと言ったのは、確か朱子だったと思う。嫌いだと言うのは、つまり好きだということぐらい、教祖はちゃんと心得ている。自分は無神論者だと名乗って出たら、教祖は却って君を買うだろうよ」と言った。 「そうだ。あんな男は嫌いだ嫌いだという女は、案外その男が好きなんだ。好きだから、嫌いだ嫌いだと言うんだ」 そう言って、山本は机の上の『信仰雑話』を取り上げ、 「これを借りていくよ」とテレくさそうに笑った。 そして赤い顔して立ち上った。 （五） “神など存在するはずがないと主張する人ほど、実は神を最も身近に感じている人だ。こちらが神を見つめていなくても、神の方でその人間をじっと見つめている。人間は神の凝視から逃れることは出来ない” 山本が帰って行ったあと、私はつくづくそう思った。山本が帰り際に『信仰雑話』を取り上げて、「無神論者でも、たまにはこういう本を読む時もあるんだよ」と言った言葉ほど、はっきりとこの間の消息を伝えているものはないだろう。 なぜ山本はこういう余計なことを言わなければいられなかったのだろうか。わざわざ冗談口のようにして言わなければならなかったのか。彼もまた有縁の徒だと言ってはいけないだろうか。彼もまた宗教に全く無縁の風来坊ではない。彼は彼の心の深淵で、ひそかに、自分でも意識せずに、神を求めている…… 私は、山本という男の半生を考えてみた。 彼は商船学校を出て、船員になった。貨物船に乗って太平洋も印度洋も幾度か往来した。しかし、ある嵐の晩、彼は急に船員稼業がいやになった。海が怖くなったのではない。星ばかりの船の上なんかで一生を送るのが急につまらなくなったのであった。港々に可愛いい女がいる。そめうちの一人とサワラの砂漠へでも逃げ込んだ方が余程気がきいていると思った。 そこで彼は、会社へ辞表を出して陸へ上った。そして、全く方面の違った工場へ入った。その工場では、大砲の弾の部品を造っていた。今から二十年も昔のことだ。 その工場で彼は又、ある日、自分が人殺しの弾を造っていることに急に嫌や気がさして来た。弁当も食べずに考えた。極めて一部分を造っているだけだが、彼は自分が直接にどこかの陣地を攻撃しているように思った。そう思うと、一日もそこで働くのが嫌やになった。彼は再び辞表を出した。 それからの彼は、一体何が本業かわからないくらい、雑文書いたり、市役所の臨時雇になったり、興行物のマネージャーをしたりして来た。現在も、下宿屋の二階の六畳に一人で寝起きして、二流作家の下請けみたいなことをして、コントやマゲモノを書いている……。 その彼――山本がいつも言っていることは、 「人間は人間を信じていれはいいのだ。あるかないかわからない神なんてものを信ずるのは、隣の座敷に多分虎がいるだろうと思うのと同じだ。座敷に虎なんぞいるものか。いるとすれば、せいぜい猫だろう」というようなことである。 私は、これを聞くたびに、山本という男が可愛いくなる。なぜなら、人間が人間を信ずる心は、取りも直さず神を信じたいと願う心に通じているからだ。彼こそひそかに隣の座敷に虎のいることを望んでいるのではないだろうか。 私は教祖が、「人間は本来、何かを拝まなければいられないものなのだよ」と優しい目をして言ったことを思い出し、彼もまた無神という神を拝んでいるのだと思った。 （六） 翌日、もう日が暮れそうになってから、山本がひょっこりやって来た。ズボンに下駄ばきで、太いステッキなど持っている。 昨日借りて行った『信仰雑話』を窓の外から差し出して、 「おい、返すよ」と言った。 「もう、読んだのか」と、私は書きもののペンをおいて言った。 「うん、ゆうべ寝床の中で、みんな読んじゃった」 「どうだね、無神論者の読後感は？」とからかうように言うと、山本はそれには答えず、 「おい、散歩に行こう」と促した。 私も今日は朝から机の前に坐っていて、いくらか肩が張って来たように思ったので、一緒に表へ出た。 二人の足は自然に城内公園の方へ向っていた。風のない暮れ方で、お濠の水に赤い雲が映っている。 石橋を渡ると、右側に橘中佐の銅像の石台だけが残っていて、広場のむこうには幾棟かの城内中学校舎が建っている。その屋根の上は、真赤に夕焼けていた。 広場の隅には、子供と遊んでいる男や、孫らしい幼児を見守っている老婆などの姿が小さく見えていた。私たちは、ブランコやすべり台には遠い藤棚の下のベンチに腰を下した。 「いいなあ」と、山本が目を細くして言った。 「なにが？」と、私はきいた。 「あすこにいる人間がだよ。こうして遠くから見ると、みんな善人にみえる」 「善人さ。みんな善人だよ。善人でなくても、夕焼空の下では、誰も善人に見える」 「じゃ、向うからこっちを眺めれば、おれも善人に見えるかな」と、山本はステッキで足もとの草を叩くようにした。 「君は善人だよ」と、私は断定するように言った。 「いや、おれはどう考えても悪人だ」 「どうして？」 「あの本に、目に見えないものを信ずる者は善人で、目に見えないものを信じない者は悪人だと書いてあった。それなら、おれは悪人でも結構だと思った」 「なあんだ、そんなことか。それなら君は善人だ」 「おれは、目に見えないものは信じられないからな。ことわっておくが、キリストが再臨するのを見ないうちは、昇天したキリストも信じないよ」 「そういうように正直に言える人間は善人なんだ。たいてい体裁のいいことを言って済ましている」 「そうかなあ」 「そうさ。復活したキリストを見た者は、ユダを除いた使徒と、それからマグダラのマリア。そんなものだ。あとの無数の人間は、見たということを聞いて、その話を信じているだけだ。それでいいのだ。君は田舎のおやじが病気だという電報を受け取っても、それを信じないかね。信じて、すぐ田舎へ帰るだろう。君などは汽車の、中で、ポロポロ涙をこぼす部類の男だよ」 （七） すっかり暗くなって来た。ブランコやすべり台で遊んでいた大人も子供も、みんなどこかへ行ってしまった。 「もう帰ろうや」と、私はベンチを立ち上りながら言った。 「どこへ帰るんだ？ 人間の帰るところなどなくなった」と、山本は敵でも斬りつけるようにステッキを振った。 「ノバリスね、あのドイツの浪漫派の。それが言っている――一体われわれはどこに行きつつあるのか？ 常に故郷へ。君だって、口ではなんとかかんとか言うが、間違いなく故郷への道をたどりつつあるのさ」と、私は歩きながら言った。 すると山本は、 「おれはダメだよ」と大きな声を出した。私はびっくりして振り向いた。 「何がダメなんだ？」 「あの借りた本の中で、実はたった一つだけ気に入った言葉があるんだ。それは動物霊という言葉だ。そこで考えてみたんだが、おれはどうも前世は蛇らしいと思った。蛇の動物霊がまだおれに幾分残っているらしい。人間霊五分に、動物霊五分というところかな。こいつはちょっと口惜しくもあるが、又一面嬉しいことでもある」 そう言って山本は、あはははと笑った。嬉しそうな笑い声ではなかった。私は瞼の裏がジーンとして来た。それで、慰めるように、こう言った。 「蛇が人間に生まれ変ったなら、君は蛇の時代によほどいいことをしたにちがいない。でなけれは、君のような善人に生まれ変れるわけがない」 「そのかわり、来世はまた蛇だよ」 「しかし、君がうそにも輪廻転生の思想を理解しているとは思わなかった」 「理解なんかしてやしないよ。だが、現在は動物霊が五分の半人間で、次の時代にはまた蛇に戻ると思っていた方が気がらくだからな。極楽浄土なんて真っ平だよ。頼まれても行きたくないね。あんな退屈なところはなかろうからなあ。一日じゅう音楽聞いて、花の降る下で寝ていなければならないなんて、全く不生産的な場所だ」 そう言いながら、山本の目は何かを見ているようであった。 “この男は何を見ているのだろうか”と、私は考えた。しかし、よくはわからなかった。ただ寂しい眼であった。それは澄んで、優しくて、蛇の目では決してなかった。 私は教祖が、「人間は神と獣の間にある生きものだ」と言った言葉を思い出した。彼は自分を動物霊五分だと言うが、仮りに前世の動物霊が残っているなら、その動物は蛇ではなく羊かも知れないと思った。「極楽なんか頼まれても行かない」などと言っているが、彼こそ最もたやすく極楽に入れる人間ではないだろうか。 「君は善人のくせに、悪人だ悪人だと広告している。そういうのを露悪趣味と言うのだ。偽善と同じように、やっぱり不自然だ」 私は叱るようにそう言って、山本の横顔を見た。山本はただ笑っていた。笑って水色の空を見ていた。 （八） 笑って水色の空を見ている山本に、私はこれだけは言ってやらなければならないと思って言った。 「君はどうしてそうウソをつきたがるんだ。涙は涙だということをちゃんと知っていながら、涙は水素と酸素と塩素の化合物だなんて言う。そしで無理に笑おうとしている。むしろ不憫だよ」 すると、山本は、私がびっくりするような大きな声で言った。 「どうせウソつきなら、偽善者より露悪家の方が気がらくだ」 「いや、それはちがう。君などはもともと唯物主義者じゃないんだ。名前はないかも知れないが、自分自身の神を認めているんだ。それなのにわざと、生命も物質から出来たものだなんて言って、自分をゴマ化している」 「ゴマ化してなどいるものか。正真正銘、世界は物から出来ていると思っている。生命だって、早い話が炭素から出来ているんだ。だから掌からモヤモヤしたものが出るなんて、おれは絶対信じない」 「というと、君は原子の物凄い崩壊作用を否定するのかね」 「それは否定しないさ。しかし、それがどうしたって言うんだい」 「掌からだって、原子崩壊の煙みたいなものが濛々と吹き出しているかも知れないじゃないか。ただ目には見えないが……」 「だが、それが病気に効くときまっているのか」 「レントゲンが発見されない前は、みんな君みたいなことを言っていたものだ。そんな光線なんてあるものかとね。そして発見されても、どうも奇妙な光線だというので、Ⅹ光線――疑問光線という名前がつけられたほどだ。ところがこのレントゲンは、ガンの治療にも使われるし、結核診断では随分重宝している」 「レントゲンならわかるさ。しかし、掌から出る光線だか煙だか電気だか知らないが、仮りにそういうものがあるとして、それがあらゆる病気に効くという説明がつけられるかい」 「説明がつけられなければ、どんな処置も認めないというならば、君はよく今日まで生きて来られたね。人生は説明じゃない。生きているというその事実だ。現代生理学も、まだ生命とは何ぞやを説明することは出来ないでいる」 山本は黙った。もうその横顔もはっきり見えないほどに暮れて来ていた。私は急に山本が可哀そうに思えて来た。 そこで、慰めるように、こう言った。 「そりゃ、僕だって、懐疑的なところもあるさ。しかし、メシヤ教の浄霊をしてもらったが治らなかったという例があるとするね。この場合、浄霊なんてものをしてもらったから死んだと考えるのはどうかな。浄霊の力も及ばなかったと素直に残念がる方が賢いと思う。名医の手術も及ばなかったと嘆く人が、浄霊の場合だけ、インチキだ瞞されたと怒るのは少し変だよ。現にそれで病気の治った人が無数にあるのだからね」 生きるも死ぬも因縁――口もとまで出たが、この言葉を私は言わなかった。 （九） 家の前で、山本と別れた。 別れる時、私は、 「花が咲いたら、どこかへ花見に行こう」といって肩を叩いた。 「うん、行こう。但しおれは花より団子だ。ただ飲むだけだ」と山本は答えた。言っている言葉ほどには元気のない声であった。 「ああ、気の済むまで飲め」 そういって私は、闇の中に消えて行く彼の後姿をいとおしむような気持で見送っていた。 玄関の格子をあけると、たたきの上に夕刊が投げ込んであった。手に取って見ると、「ホー軍、仏陣地を猛爆」という初号活字の三段見出しが目についた。 今日も赤道に近いヴェトナム戦線では、人間同志が互いに撃ち合っている。 私は机の前へ坐っても、どうも落ちつけなかった。 “なぜ、これだけ人智が進みながら、戦争はなくならないのか。なぜ、国と国とが殺し合いをしなくても、みんなで仲よく生きていける世界が出来ないのか。何かまだ人間は間違っている。三十万年前に猿から進化したという人間が、その時進化しきれなかったシッポを、まだ一センチほどおしりにぶら下げている” そんなことを思った。 “戦争が、貧乏をつくる。貧乏が、病気をつくる。病気がまた、貧乏をつくる。そして、その貧乏が、戦争をつくり上げる。どこまで行っても、この三つはくるくる回転している。要するに、人間の知恵は進んだが、それはまだ動物知の域を脱け出しきっていないのだ。いつかは、人間はこの三大悪を根絶やしにするだろう。それが出来なければ、動物園の檻の前に立って、汝等猿類よなどと威張れたものではないはずだ” こんなことも思った。 私ほ机の引出しから『善言讃詞』を取り出して、戦争のない世界の歓喜を歌っているくだりを読んでみた。そこには、こういう意味のことが書いてある―― 「……国と国とのあいだに境界線などというケチなものもなく、人種がちがうからと言って憎み合ったり争うなどということもなくなり、一天四海、人類は観音のめぐみの中に抱かれるようになる」 これはなんという壮麗な世界建築であろう。しかし、それにしても、どうしたら戦争をなくすることが出来るだろうか。私は、教祖が言っていた言葉を思い出した。 「今日の日本に不足しているものは、米でもなけれは、電力でもない。保安隊でもなければ、結核患者のベッドでもない。ただ神様に手を合わせる人間が不足しているだけだ」 その神とは何か。それは生命をつくった者の名だ。神のつくった生命を殺すもの、虫ばむもの、泣かせるもの――そういうものをなくしてしまわなければならない。 私は、窓の戸を締めようと思って、立ち上った。 月が出ていた。私は月光を吸って息づいている目の前の桜のつぼみを、いつまでも見ていた。

―― 岡田自観師の論文集 ―― 御教え検索 ： help 資料検索 ： 伝道の手引き Ⅱ －１－３ 御神体について 九、御神体を奉斎し替える場合の心得 １ 御神体のお祀り変え（その一） 〔 御光話（S24年 4月23日） 『御光話録』7号、昭和24(1949)年**月**日発行〕 ――御軸のお祀り替えをさせていただきますとき、いままでお祀り申し上げた御軸に、お供え物をいたし、お祀りし、御礼を申し上げるべきと存じますがいかがでしょうか。 『それはそうですね、いままでの御礼をしなければいけませんよ。』 御神体のお祀り変え（その二） 〔 御垂示（S26年8月8日） 『御垂示録』1号、昭和26(1951)年9月15日発行〕 「大光明如来様をいただきまして、光明如来様をおしまいする場合に染抜きをしておしまいすべきでしょうか」 『それは、染抜きをしたが良い。』 ２ 御神体の表装をし直す時（その一） 〔 御垂示（S28年6月1日） 『御垂示録』21号、昭和28(1953)年6月15日発行〕 「御神体の表装を立派な物にしたいという場合はいたしましてもよろしいでしょうか」 『たいていはよいですが、場所は前の所と同じですか。』 「さようでございます」 『前の表装は紙ですか布ですか。』 「紙でございます」 『それは布のに取り替えてよいです。その場合によくお断りするのです。「縁がお粗末で申し訳ないから、もっと上等なのに取り替えたいから」とお断りしてすればよいです。』 「その場合新しく御神体をいただくということはいかがでございましょうか」 『構いません。そうして前のは大事にしまっておいて、親戚で拝みたいのがあったときはお貸ししてもよいです。』 御神体の表装をし直す時（その二） 〔 御垂示（S29年4月1日） 『御垂示録』30号、昭和29(1954)年4月15日発行〕 「光明如来様を奉斎いたしておりましたが、大光明如来様を拝受いたしましたので、光明如来様を信者に貸しておりました。最近大光明如来様の紙の白いほうにお花のシミができたりし表装直しをいたしますについて、前の光明如来様が帰っておりますので、これを奉斎いたしたいと思いますが、一旦人に貸したものをそのまま奉斎することはいかがでございましょうか」 『それは構わないです。貸したものは返すのが当たり前です。あげたものはいけませんが、貸したものならよいです。』 ３ 人から譲られた御神体故、新しく頂きたい 〔 御垂示（S29年3月1日） 『御垂示録』29号、昭和29(1954)年3月15日発行〕 「現在御奉斎の光明如来様は人から譲り受けたものでございますが、最近精神的に気掛りになりますので、新しくお受けいたしたいと――」 『本当はそのほうがよいです。 こういうことを知っておかなければならないのです。以前はよかったが、これからはいけないことがあるのです。すなわち、神様のほうは厳しくなったのです。というのは、和光同塵と言って、以前は神様はたいていなことは許されたのです。それが時期が進むに従ってすべてがはっきりしてくるのです。そうすると以前は許されたことも、これからは許されなくなるということがずいぶんあるのです。だからこれからはだんだん、物事を几帳面にはっきりしてゆくということが肝腎なのです。』 十、お汚しした時の心得 １ 御神体に蝿がたかる事について 〔 御垂示（S28年5月1日） 『御垂示録』20号、昭和28(1953)年5月15日発行〕 「もう一つは、やはり田舎でございますが、ハエが多くて御神体にたかりますので申しわけないと思いますが、セロファンか何かで覆いをいたしますのはいかがでございましょうか」 『そういうことは必要ありません。ハエのクソでも、鳥でも、人間以外のものは御無礼にはなりません。そういうことを言うと、神社の屋根に鳥がクソをかけるからと、瓦に何かしなければならないことになります。』 ２ 花粉等で御神体をお汚しした場合 〔 御光話（S24年 5月23日） 『御光話録』10号、昭和24(1949)年7月10日発行〕 ――誤って御軸または小観音様を汚しました場合、いかがいたしたらよろしいでしょうか。 『汚したって、どういうふうに汚したんですか。』 ――例えば、百合の花の花粉がついたりいたしました場合…… 『それはね、経師屋に頼んでとってもらえばいいですよ。そのときにはお詫びしてね、こういうわけできれいにいたしますから、その間お許し願いたいってお断りしてやればいいです。』 ３ 御神体にクモの糞のかかった例 〔 御垂示（S29年4月1日） 『御垂示録』30号、昭和29(1954)年4月15日発行〕 「信者、御奉斎の御神体に御無礼があったことにつき、お詫びと御垂示をお願い申し上げます。そうとうに大きなクモが糞をかけ、御文字に三、四分の大きさについております。いかがいたしましたらよろしいでしょうか」 『経師屋（きょうじや）で洗ってもらってもよいし、それで具合が悪ければ新しく受け直せばよいです。』 ４ 蚊の血のついた例 〔 御垂示（S29年2月1日） 『御垂示録』28号、昭和29(1954)年2月15日発行〕 「御神体の左のほうに蚊の血と思われるものが二センチほどついておりますのに気がつきましたが、これは何か御神業上の間違いがあったのかとも思いましたが、どのようなわけでございましょうか」 『無論何かあったのですが、小さいことです。経師屋（きょうじや）に洗ってもらえばよいです。』 「経師屋に聞きましたところ、血のついたのは取れないそうです」 『では、紙で埋めてもらえばよいです。経師屋が分からないように上手にやります。』 ５ 御神体をお茶で汚した場合 〔 御垂示（S26年8月8日） 『御垂示録』1号、昭和26(1951)年9月15日発行〕 「大光明如来様にお茶をこぼし紙が汚れました場合はいかがいたしましたらよろしいでしょうか」 『経師屋（きょうじや）に頼んで洗ってもらえば良い。字にはかかっていなくても紙が汚れてはいけない。』 ６ 鶯に御神体を汚された例 〔 御光話（S25年 3月28日） 『御光話録』19号、昭和25(1950)年6月13日発行〕 ――先日、突然鶯が家の中へ飛び込んできまして御軸に止まりましたので、御神前を汚してはたいへんと存じ追いましたところ、飛び立つ瞬間に御軸に粗相をしてしまいました。 『鶯が止まるってのはいいんですがね。これは間違えたんですね。いけないと思ったから追ったんで、追われたから粗相してしまったんですよ。』 ――汚しました御神体はいかがいたしますればよろしいでしょうか。 『汚した場所が文字にかかってるんですか。』 ――かかっておりません。 『じゃ、経師屋（きょうじや）に頼んで洗い落としたらいいですよ。鶯が止まるなんて本当に結構なんですがね。そのこと知らなかったんですね。』 ７ 御神体の裏に字を書いた人へ 〔 御垂示（S29年4月1日） 『御垂示録』30号、昭和29(1954)年4月15日発行〕 「だいぶ以前に二、三人が一緒に光明如来様をいただき、同じ表装屋に出しましたが、その中の一人が、もし間違ってはいけないというので、御神体の裏の隅に墨で自分の名前を書き入れ、そのまま奉斎しておりましたが、最近それが申しわけないとお詫びにまいっております。いかがいたしましたらよろしいでしょうか」 『表装して見えませんか。』 「表からは見えません」 『裏からも見えないでしょう。そうしたら、そのことを言えば、私が許せばよいのですから、それでよいです。』 ８ 子供が御神体に鉛筆でいたずら書した事について 〔 教えの光（地上天国28号) 、昭和26(1951)年9月25日発行〕 「私事、七月の石田教会のお祭りに参拝いたしました留守に、六歳になります子供（忠明）がお座敷に入り、御神体の光明如来様の字の一番下方の向かって右下の白い所に、鉛筆にて約一寸くらいの縦条を三つ書いておりましたのを、帰宅いたした翌朝気がつき、さっそく祝詞、善言讃詞を奏げてお詫び申し上げ、子供によく注意いたしまして後、消しゴムに御浄霊して、謹んで消させていただきました。まことに相すまぬことをいたさせました。お許しくださいませ。また今後の御垂示を謹んでお願いいたします。」 『それだけなら別にたいしたことはないからよろしいが、原因は御神体を敬う心に、いささか隙があったためである。』 ９ 御神体の“光”に小さな穴が明いた例 〔 御垂示（S27年10月1日） 『御垂示録』14号、昭和27(1952)年10月15日発行〕 「御神体の「光」という御文字に米粒くらいの穴があきましたが、いかがいたしましたらよろしいでしょうか」 『これは取り換えなければいけません。それはやっぱり意味があるのです。つまりたとえてみれば、それを経師屋（きょうじや）が非常に穢したか、あるいはなにかで穢したかで、神様にはそれが面白くないのですから、取り換えることです。』 10 御神体の紐の切れた例 〔 御垂示（S28年5月1日） 『御垂示録』20号、昭和28(1953)年5月15日発行〕 「四十六歳の婦人。主人は二十五年一月入信、ただちに御屏風観音様を御奉斎させていただき、三月に御神体を御奉斎させていただいております。本年一月十七日朝お参りの際御神体の巻き紐が根元から刃物で切ったように切れて落ちており、教会にてお詫びして紐の取替えの手続きをいたしました。祖霊の知らせではないかと思い、仏壇が粗末でしたので新しいのにいたしました。一月十八日より子供（入信者、十四歳）が頭痛、発熱、貧血等の御浄化をいただき、真っ青になり死相の現われたこともございました。また京都の伏見稲荷を信仰しておりまして、主人は御利益をいただいたこともあり、まだ執着がとれず、室内に祀っております。主人の無理解のため稲荷の話をすると目の色を変えて怒りますので、屋外に移すこともできません。私も人工流産をしたことがございまして、罪深い者でございます。これらのことに関係がございましょうか」 『伏見稲荷はいつから信仰してますか。』 「十年前からでございます」 『今どこに祀ってますか。』 「御神体は二階に、稲荷は階下でございます」 『紐を切って、今は紐をつけて掛けてあるのですか。』 「紐を新しくいたしまして御掛けしております」 『しかしそれはそのままではいけないのです。紐を取り替えて、私が浄めなければならないのです。』 「まことに申しわけございません」 『そうでなければ光明如来様の本当の光は出ないのです。一旦落ちたものは霊を入れ替えなければなりません。早速そうしなさい。 それから伏見のお稲荷さんには悪い狐がずいぶんいますから、やっぱりそれを改心させなければならないです。二、三年もたてばたいてい改心しますが、それはまだ執着がある狐とみえます。だからいくらかは何かやります。しかし光明如来様の光で、そういうことはだんだんできなくなりますが、今のように落ちたりすると本当の光がでません。これはお詫びくらいでは駄目なのです。ちゃんと霊を入れてあげますから、それから一年以上たてばお稲荷さんを処分してもよいです。それまでは処分してはいけません。ですからよく雨の染みができたり、いろんなことがあって経師屋に直させたりしますが、それは必ず私の所に浄めに持って来ます。それをしなければいけないのです。』 11 台風で御神体を汚した人へ 〔 御垂示（S26年11月1日） 『御垂示録』4号、昭和26(1951)年12月10日発行〕 「台風により、家が吹きまくられそうになり、主人が留守中なので奥さんが、子供二人をかかえて、近所に避難しました。家は雨戸を吹き飛ばされ、御神体もはずれ、雨戸が上に乗り、全体的に雨に濡れましたが」 『経師屋（きょうじや）に直してもらったら良い。そうして、でき上がったら持ってきなさい。ちゃんと浄めて霊を入れて上げます。』 12 御神体の身代り 〔 御垂示（S28年10月1日） 『御垂示録』25号、昭和28(1953)年10月15日発行〕 「今度の十三号の台風で、高潮により、本人は御守護をいただきましたが、光明如来様は表装の天だけを残し、御屏風観音様も行方不明となりました。謹んでお詫び申し上げます」 『それは身代わりになるということもあるのです。』 13 御神体に雨漏りのシミのついた例 〔 教えの光（地上天国24号) 、昭和26(1951)年5月25日発行〕 「昭和二十三年三月に入信、二十四年八月に光明如来様、二十五年三月には大光明如来様を御奉斎された信者さんですが、二十六年三月に床の間に雨漏りがいたし、恐れ多くも御神体の左肩にしみがつきました。謹みてお詫び申し上げます。これはなにかのお知らせでございましょうか。またいかに取り扱わしていただいたらよろしゅうございましょうか。御教示お願い申し上げます。」 『無論、わけがあるから、よく考えてみれば判るはずである。文字が汚れていないで、紙だけなら経師屋に洗ってもらえばよいが、文字が酷（ひど）く汚れていれば新しいのと取り替えるほうがよい。』 14 御神体にダンダン斑点が出てくる人へ 〔 御垂示（S27年10月1日） 『御垂示録』14号、昭和27(1952)年10月15日発行〕 「昨年十月御神体を御奉斎させていただきましたが、四月より御神体に黄色い斑点が浮び、最近少しずつ増えてまいりましたので心配いたしております。経師屋は別に御無礼をしたこともないようでございます。いかなるわけでございましょうか」 『やっぱりわけがあるのです。今も斑点が増えつつあるのですか。それでは、もう増えなくなったら持って来て下さい。私が見てあげます。増えるだけ増えてからです。』 15 引続き二度御神体にシミが出た人へ 〔 御垂示（S29年4月1日） 『御垂示録』30号、昭和29(1954)年4月15日発行〕 「二十六年十一月大光明如来様を御奉斎し、二十七年四月頃御文字に雨漏りのシミができ、当時お伺いし焼却せよとのお言葉をいただき、焼却いたしました。二十七年七月光明如来様を御奉斎のお許しをいただきましたが、その家は山陰（やまかげ）で非常に湿っけまして、昨年六月頃より御神体の御文字でない白い所に薄くシミが出てまいり、本年になって濃くなってまいりました」 『その人は教師ですか。』 「一信者でございます」 『信仰に入ったのはいつですか。』 「二十五年頃と思います」 『四月に焼却して三ヶ月の間お祀りしてなかったわけですが、そうすると信仰のほうはボヤボヤしているのでしょう。そのためですね。』 「本人は支部のほうでお使いいただいております。兄の家で、兄夫婦がおります。弟が拝受いたしまして―」 『本人はどこかの支部に泊りきりになっていて、奉斎してある所には、住んでいる人は兄さんですか。』 「さようでございます」 『それではぜんぜん意味がないではないですか。』 「兄さん夫婦も入信しております」 『兄さん夫婦も御神体をお受けしているのですか。』 「いいえ」 『兄さん夫婦がお受けして拝むのが本当でしょう。それを、弟が奉斎して、他に行ってしまっているのでは、空ッポです。つまり「神は順序なり」で、順序が正しくなければいけないのです。肝腎な兄貴がお受けしないで、弟がというのは変です。そういうものなのです。』 「それは早速お巻きしまして」 『それは文字にはないのでしょう。だからそれは経師屋で落としてもらって表装をやり替えて、今度弟がお祀りするようになったら、そのときにこっちにお浄めに持って来なさい。浄めてあげます。それから奉斎するのです。』 「兄さんの御神体奉斎」 『それはそっちの勝手です。拝みたければ奉斎するし、嫌ならよせばよいです。』 16 出火で工場を焼き、御神体を焼いた人へ 〔 妙智之光（地上天国９号） 、昭和24(1949)年10月25日発行〕 「私は自動車のタイヤ修理工場を経営している者であります。去る五月二十七日午前十時ごろちょうど私が浄霊に出かけた後でしたが、階下より突然発火し、ガソリンタンクに引火して手のつけようもなく、五分間ばかりの間に建坪四十二坪を全焼し、畏れ多いことでございますが階上の光明如来様も御写真もその他御額も焼失いたしました。心よりお詫び申し上げます。火災の二、三日前、長女和子が家の内外が、「キナ臭い」と申しておりましたが、かくのごとき結果になるとは思いませんでした。しかし不意のことで、かつ私の不在中にもかかわらず一人の怪我人もなく、家内一同無事でありましたことは御守護の賜と厚く御礼申し上げます。右のうち長女が、「キナ臭い」と申したのはいかなる理由でしょうか。」 『「キナ臭い」と言うのは霊界で二、三日前にすでに火事になってしまった。それで臭った。理由としてこういうことがある。この人の財産に汚れがあるため浄化された。こういう浄化はよくある。例えば祖先が道に外れたことによって、すなわち払うべきものを払わなかったり、出すべきものを出さなかったり、人を苦しめたりして金を貯めたのがよくあるが、その人が信仰に入って大きな御神徳を与えてくださるのに、過去の不純な財産が邪魔になる。すなわち嚢の中が汚れていてはよいものが入れられぬので、その嚢をきれいにするのである。またこういうこともある。火事などで焼けるのは汚れを非常に早くとられるわけである。ふつう相場に手を出したり息子が道楽したりしてなくすこともあるが、その浄化がすむときっとあといいことになる。よく道楽息子が金を湯水のごとく使うのは祖霊がするので、それをしないと一家断絶するので、それを救うためで、これは割合長くかかる。しかし霊的のことを人間は知らないから怒ったり悲観したりするのであるが、後はきっとよくなる。或〔既〕に入信した人はある程度不純なものがとれてからはウンと神様から結構な御神徳をくださるもので、この人もそれである。勿論うんと財物をくださる。ふつうは御神徳で火事を免れるものだが、この人は不純物がたくさんあったわけだ。また浄化にも時期があって、私など二十年くらい借金で苦しみぬいた。いまにうんと金が入ると人に話してから十年くらいたって、昭和十六年に借金を全部すませた。それから予想外に金が入るようになった。金が欲しい金が欲しいと思うときにはなかなか入らなかったが、諦めて神様任せにしたらそれからどんどん入ることになった。おもしろいものである。』 17 御奉斎の目的が間違って居たので御神体を破かれた例 〔 御垂示（S26年10月8日） 『御垂示録』3号、昭和26(1951)年11月25日発行〕 「親戚に親子の仲の悪いところがあり、このお救いを話し、御神体奉斎し、その後御参拝に来ませんで、子供が御神体を破いたことがありました。三年ほど前でございます」 『親父は信仰に入っているんですか。』 「さようでございます」 『どういうわけで信仰に入ったんですか。』 「家庭が仲良くなかったので、それをなくするために勧めましたが、子供がいたずらした後、お迎えするようにお話しましたら、いただきたいと言うのですが、そのとき家が納まらなかったので、私のほうで奉斎しております。向うからくるのを待つべきでしょうか」 『無論です。最初から無理してお祀りしたんですからね。いま言ったように神様を仲直りの道具に使った。本人が信仰に入って、御神書を読んで立派な信仰だ。ぜひお祀りさせて下さい。というのなら良いが、本当に分からないうちに押しつけるようにして祀らせたのでは、神様に対して御無礼になる。ありがたい、ぜひ自分もそういう神様を拝みたいという切なる気持ちでお祀りしてこそ、はじめて神様は――人間と同じですよ――気持ちが良いです。人間だって、あの人にぜひ来ていただきたい、助けていただきたいという気持の所に行ったほうが良いでしょう。それを、その気持ちがないのに、押売り的に行っても、先が心から歓迎しないからね、心からでないと、光が強く出ない。お祀りして、人間が本当に敬まって崇（あが）めると、光が強くなる。だから、一家揃って、一番浄い所にお祀りすると、光が違う。それを、人間以下に――人間が上に住んでいたりしては、光が出ないんです。そういうわけなんです。』 18 御奉斎の目的が誤っていた為、雨でしみの出来た例 〔 御垂示（S26年11月8日） 『御垂示録』4号、昭和26(1951)年12月10日発行〕 「大光明如来様の『大』の字に雨漏りがして――」 『それはいけないですね。』 「染み抜きを頼みますと、薬品を使いますが、よろしいので――」 『染み抜きもいけません。文字に関係しない――紙なら、経師屋でも良いが、文字に関係したらもういけないです。取り替えなければいけない。』 「あとはどのように――」 『しまっておきなさい。いや、焼いたほうが良いですね。よくお詫びしてね。やっぱり、何か間違った点があるんです。』 「祖母が亡くなった日に、結婚式と大光明如来様の御魂祀りをさせていただき、それを見なければ死なれないと言うので――」 『それだね。間違っているからね。ですから、お詫びして焼けば良い。』 19 反対者に御神体を破られた人へ ① 事件当時 〔 教えの光（地上天国48号) 、昭和28(1953)年5月25日発行〕 「罪穢多き私たちにも日々御守護賜り、入信後は特に尊き御奉仕のお許しいただきまして、まことにありがたく厚く御礼申し上げます。 このたび畏れ多くもたいへんなことを起こしまして、なんとお詫び申し上げてよろしいやら、途方に暮れております。 明主様御写真に大光明如来様、御書体、五六七の御額に対し奉りまして申し訳なくも破損いたしましたことを深く深くお詫び申し上げます。不祥事の原因を御報告申し上げます。 去る三月三日、十九時三十分ごろでございます。第十八号御教え集を拝読さしていただいていた時でございます。妻の次兄が来まして、「お前たちは子供もない者が商売もせず、年老いてどうする。自分の家もない者が」と平常の小言でございますが、酒気を帯びておりますので、妻と顔見あわせて黙っておりましたところ、「生意気な光明さんがなんだ、他人の金をまきあげてみんな上げて自分たちはいつも文なしでいて薬は毒だ、注射は悪い、なぞよくもそんな大それたことを言うて、他人にすむか、馬鹿者どもが、光明さんがなんだ俺のほうがよほどありがたいんだ、拝みたいなら俺を拝め」など、すごい顔をしてにらみながら大声に繰り返すので、たまりかねて「神様の悪口言うな」と一言やり返しますと、「兄に向かって不都合なことを言うか、この家は俺の家だぞ、俺の言うことを聞かぬ奴は出て行け、たったいま出て行け」と、ますます狂い出したのでございます。この家は私の買った家で当時満州に居住していました関係で、妻の長兄の名儀になっております。 妻の次兄には私たちが入信時の昭和二十二年ごろから、たびたびお道のお話しを伝えさしていただいておりますが、理解ができませず、家族の病が御浄霊をいただいて癒されましても感謝の念もなく、月日の経つに従い本教の信仰に反感を抱くようになり、本教の悪口を言いふらすので、布教の面にもたいへん都合が悪くなりました。 昨年一月には謀計をめぐらし、私の出張不在中に妻を悪口ずくで以前の住居から追い出したのでございますが、妻の父の計らいで現在の家に住むようになったほどでございます。それなのにまたも「出て行け」と無法な言葉に私も腹がたちましたので、「なにを言うか」と言うたのに対して、いまにもつかみかかりそうな気配に、相手になることの大人気ないのを気づいたので、妻のすすめもありましたので、戸外に出ようとしたとき大きな物音に振り返ると、室の硝子戸を破って妻の上に馬のりになって、「貴様たちを殺してやる、殺してしまえば俺も楽になる。お前らの姿を見るのは胸糞が悪い」と言いながら、髪の毛をつかんでたたいておりますので、室に引き返してみますと、御教え集第十八号はさんざんに破って散らしてありますので、私も本当に怒って次兄を外に突き出しましたが、こんな者を相手にしていては御用ができなくなるとたいへんだと考えましたので、近所の人に後を頼んで妻の父の家に行った後で、次兄は引き返してきたのでございます。 近所の人たちが来ましたとき、二階でバリバリ音がするので、上がってみると、もったいなくも大光明如来様の御神体をはずし「明如」の御文字の間を横に引き破り、五、六、七の御額を落としてあり、なお、手を伸ばして御写真に近づいたので、後から抱き止めたそうです。ところがものすごい力ではね飛ばされ、障子につき当たってひるむ暇に畳の上に落として、御額縁をこわし、畏れ多きことでございますが、明主様御写真の御衿の、おすその辺りに約一寸くらいの瑕（きず）を出かしましたことを深くお詫び申し上げます。 御写真の御額縁は新しいのを取り替えさしていただきました。御写真はそのままでよろしゅうございましょうか。 大光明如来様、御書体は三月四日、中教会にお預けいたしております。今後の御処置いかがいたしましたらよろしゅうございましょうか。 御垂示のほど、謹んでお願い申し上げます。 お詫びがかないまして再度御神体をお迎えさしていただけます日の、一日も速やからんことを御祈願申し上げます。」 『当分そのままにしていればよろしい。万事神様にお任せしておけば、いずれ時が来るからそのときお祀りすればいい。このような乱暴されるということは、深い理由があるのであって、いずれは必ず分かるから、それまで少しも心配せず待つことである。ちなみに意外なことがある場合もあるが、必ず意味があるのであるから、乱暴者を恨んだり憎んだりしてはいけない。というのは、理由があって神様がそうさしたかもしれないからである。』 ② 解決後 （浄化作用 P206） 〔 御垂示（S29年4月1日） 『御垂示録』30号、昭和29(1954)年4月15日発行〕 「昨年五月御垂示（地上天国四十八号）いただきました染矢義彦でございますが、本人も感激して、反省し、その後御神業に努力してまいりました。三ヵ月ほど前に兄さんのほうからお詫びして「たいへん申しわけないことをした、今までのことは許してくれ」と言ってきまして、その後仲もよく、兄弟の努力の結果、当時より信者も倍になりました。再び大光明如来様の御奉斎をお許しいただきたいと思います」 『よいです。もう、そうなれば―。そういうこともやっぱりわけがあるのです。そういうような段取りにしなければならないわけがあるのです。こういうことを知っておかなければならないです。これは大本教のお筆先に「今度は二度目の天の岩戸開きであるから」ということがあるのです。というのは、ずっと古い時代ですが、以前にもこれに似たようなことが世界にあったのです。それで今度は私が出てから、岩戸開き、要するに昼間の世界になるということは二度目になるわけです。すると、あらゆることが二度目になるのです。これは信者の人にもそういうことがよくあります。最初やったことがいけなくて、それからやり替えたりして、二度目の形をとるのです。私などは始終そうです。ほとんど例外はないと言ってよいくらいです。だから今の御神体をそうするのも、二度目の型をとったわけでは（ﾏﾏ）そういう人はたくさんあるに違いないです。二度目が本当だというわけです。だから今度できたメシヤ会館にしても、前には下の今の美術館の所に造るつもりだったのですが、あのときの大風でくずれたのです。今美術館の、上る道路を造っている所です。そういうようで、せっかく造ったのにくずれたので、それで上に変えたのです。そのときも「ああ、やはり二度目だな」と思ってやったのです。だから何事にもそういうことがあります。』 「二度目になるのも決まっているわけでございますか」 『決まっているということもないが、二度目の型をとることが多いのです。』 「型をするのはお許しがいただけるわけでございますか」 『型をすると言っても、人間のほうでするということは間違ってます。つまりそういうことがよくあるというわけです。一度目で済めば結構ですよ。』 附 行者に御神体を外されたら息の絶えた人の話 〔 御垂示（S26年10月5日） 『御垂示録』3号、昭和26(1951)年11月25日発行〕 「三年ほど前に入信、お蔭をいただいておりましたが、その後やっておらず、最近病気をして、御獄（みたけ）教や日蓮の行者が来て、こんなものを掛けているからいけないと、御守り（光明如来様）をはずしてしまい、それを燃やしつけると、燃え終わると同時に、息が絶えてしまったのだそうです」 『やっぱり、その人はそれだけの――霊的に極く低いんですね。第一、御獄の行者に言われて、それを信じるようじゃ問題にならないですからね。』 20 愚問の例 附 お汚しした御神体の後の処置について 〔 御垂示（S26年11月8日） 『御垂示録』4号、昭和26(1951)年12月10日発行〕 「先ほどの大光明如来様は、ただ今支部にお預りしておりますが、お焼きするときはどのようにして」 『だから、お詫びして――御神体をお焼きしますから、どうぞお許し願います、とお断りして、巻いたままで床の間に置いて――。』 「火鉢か何かで――」 『庭で良いでしょう。』 「そのときに天津祝詞を――」 『いいや、祝詞は奏げなくても良い。』 （中略） 「先ほどお焼きしました御神体の灰は、どこに捨てましたらよろしいでしょうか」 『灰はどこに捨てても良いです。そのときはすでに霊は抜けてます。物質ですからね。』 「その場合に、御書体のみ取り替えさせていただくのは、いかかでしょうか」 『そうですね。それで良いですね。表装がもったいないからね。けれでも、なるだけなら――いさぎ良く――表装も大したものじゃないから、――焼いたほうが――そのほうが気持ちが良いです。どのくらい経っているんですか。』 「まだあまり年数が経たない信者で、一ヵ月お掛けしないくらいでございます」 『それじゃ、特に惜しいから、ぴったり表装をはめないで、御書体のまわりに一つ布をやって、そうして使ったら良い。そんなら良い。値段はどのくらいですか。』 「四、五千円でございます」 『それは、惜しいな。今度持って来てごらんなさい。私が見てあげます。うまく利用のできるような方法を考えてあげますから。』 附 御神体を犬に汚された事について 〔 御垂示（S27年9月1日） 『御垂示録』12号、昭和27(1952)年8月25日発行〕 「犬がじゃれつき御神体に――」 『座敷に置いた犬ですか。』 「隣の時計屋で犬と猫を飼っており、奥さんについて来た犬がじゃれつき、ほとんど分からないほどですが「来」の字にかかっております」 『隣の時計屋の人が犬を連れて来たというわけですか。その犬は座敷に住んでいる犬ですか。』 「座敷に住んでおります」 『それは、見て気がつかないくらいですか。』 「さようでございます」 『気がつかないくらいならそれで良いですが、良くお詫びして浄めれば良いです。それからこの次は犬を一緒に連れて来ないようにということをよく言って、そうしてもしか連れて来たときは、犬だけ遠慮してもらいたいと頼むのです。だいたい犬は座敷に上がるということは嘘です。法に外れているのです。犬というのは、土間にいるのですから、土間におくべきです。しかも神様をお祀りしてあるところに四足を入れるということはたいへんな御無礼です。信者というものは気がゆるんでいるのです。神様に対する尊敬心を忘れているか、ゆるんでいるかしているのです。だから隙があるわけです。』 「同じ時計屋で、同業者の関係がありますので、時々見えますために心配しております。明主様にお伺いしてくるからと、一時お外ししてまいりました」 『飛んでもないです。その考え方というのがどうかしている。それは一日も一刻も早く御神体を――離せないとか、しまえないとか、という観念がなくてはいけないのです。それを御無礼とかなんて言うのはぜんぜん問題になりません。もしそう思ったら、そのところの家に何か囲いを竹か何かで作って、犬を連れて来たときはそのところに入れる。さもなければ犬を連れて来たら断ったらどうですか。私の所は神様をお祀りしてあるので御無礼があっては困るからと言うのが当然です。それで承知しなかったら絶交すれば良いのです。そのくらいの信念がなければ本当に信仰に入っているのではない。あなたもそういうことは良く言い聞かせなさい。そういうことは肝腎なことだから、しっかりしなければいけない。』 十一、御祀りしていた信者が亡くなった場合、又は信仰を離れた場合等の、御神体の取扱い方について １ 亡くなった人の御神体を譲って頂いてよいか 〔 御光話（S23年 7月28日） 『御光話録』発行年月日不明、推定昭和26年頃。〕 ――教導師が死亡した場合、御軸などをそのまま他の教導師がいただくことはいかがでしょうか。 『結構です。』 ２ 未信者の手に渡っていた光明如来様について 〔 御垂示（S29年2月1日） 『御垂示録』28号、昭和29(1954)年2月15日発行〕 「六月に入信の信者でございますが、十月頃懇意にしている近所の酒屋に行きますと、奥の部屋に「光明如来様」の御神体を祀ってあるので入信しているのですかと聞くと、入信はしてないというのでした。しかし光明如来様を奉斎してあるではないかと言うと、あれは私が別に祀っているのでも何でもない。どこかその近くの人らしいが、持って来て買ってくれないかというので譲り受けて掛けているということなので、実はこれはこういうもったいない御神体だと話したところ、それは家ではもったいないから持って行ってくれというわけで持ってまいりましたが、いかようにいたしたらよろしゅうございましょうか」 『それは浄めればよいです。』 ３ 信者が亡くなってお祀りする方の無くなった御神体について 〔 御垂示（S26年4月1日） 『御垂示録』6号、昭和27(1952)年1月25日発行〕 「御神体とお屏風の観音様のお取り扱いにつきましてお伺い申し上げます。主人が亡くなり、家族が解らなくなって教会にお返しに来たのでございます」 『取扱いと言って――先方が返そうと言うんでしょう。だからそれを、うまくやればいいでしょう。』 「処置につきまして――」 『しまっておけば良い。』 「永久にでございましょうか」 『いやそれは解らない。それはいただいたほうが良い。それであなたの所にしまっておき、そのうちに急いでお祀りしたいというときに貸してやる。ただしそれはお浄めしなければ。お浄めする場合には資格者なら良いです。自分の所にお祀りしてある光明如来様にお願いして、お浄めの資格をいただき「今お浄めをさせていただくから力をお与え下さい」とお願いしておけば良い。胸から霊を入れる。それで良いです。つまり台の上において、祝詞を奏げたほうがいいですね―― 天津祝詞を。拍手して二、三分で良いですね。そして拍手をして、お辞儀をして、そのとき「しまわせていただきますから」と言って、しまう。上に物をのせないようにね。その家で一番清い所に置いて、箱があったら箱に入れて、そうすると中にはお祀りしたいがお金が足りないというときは出してやる。あるいは貸さなければならない場合にね。未信者に病人があって、将来入信する――入信すると言うのでなければならない――そういうとき、使っても良い。返ったら戸棚にしまって、光明如来様にお礼をして――それで良い。お屏風はそれ程大げさにしなくても、もっと簡単で良い。御神前にお上げして「どうかお浄めをお願いします」と、それだけで良い。』 「たいへん穢れていたり、お汚しした場合は――」 『それはいけません――取り換えなければね。ただ古いのは良いが、破損しているのはいけないですね。』 「その処置はいかにいたしましたらよろしゅうございましょうか」 『お断りして焼いても良いでしょう。』 ４ 邪教に迷った教師の御神体の御取扱いにつき 〔 御垂示（S26年12月6日） 『御垂示録』5号、昭和26(1951)年12月25日発行〕 「本教の教師をしており、大光明如来様と光明如来様をいただいており、新しい宗教に迷い、大光明如来様を表装からはずし、今度もらってきた御神体を掛け、その表具屋は本教信者で、そこの家に大光明、光明如来様はいらないからと言って置いて行き、表具屋で預っておりますがどういう風にいたしましたらよろしいでしょうか」 『取っておきなさい。』 「表具屋にでございますか」 『そうです。どうせ今に、その人はじたばたするから、そのときに返してやれば良い。』 「他の人で、いただきたいと言うのに――」 『それはいけません。今に謝ってきたら、先の通りにやってやったら良い。どうせ――見ててごらんなさい。たいへんなことになる。下手なことをすると、命をなくすることになる。命をなくしないうちに気がつくと幸せだがね。新宗教に悪く言われるんですよ。いろいろね。それで迷っちゃう。しかし、珍しい話ですね。邪神にやられたんですね。しかし、そういうのは、あながち非難することはできないです。というのは、他の宗教をやって見て、ひどい目に合って、それから目が覚めて熱心になるということもありますからね。中途で止めるということもあながちそれっきりになることはないから、メシヤ教以上のものはないから、いずれは目が覚めるに決まっているから、そういうのはうっちゃらかして時期を待つんです。邪神は――どうも、いろんなことをやってますよ。邪神といっても、邪神は誰に憑るかというと、信者に憑るんですね。邪神としては、一番効果があるんですね。未信者に憑っても大して効果はない。メシヤ教が一番怖いんだからね。邪神のほうで、腕のある奴はメシヤ教の信者にくっついていろいろやろうとする。すごいものですよ。』 ５ 邪教に迷った信徒の御神体のお取扱いについて 〔 御垂示（S28年12月1日） 『御垂示録』27号、昭和28(1953)年12月15日発行〕 「二十三年に入信の信者でございますが、二年ほどして神霊科学（亀井三郎の弟子）に迷い、それがために夫婦離別をし、御奉斎いたしておりました光明如来様は、御無礼があっては申しわけないから引取ってもらいたいということで支部で引取り、献金も返してくれというので返しました」 『献金を返せというのはないです。貸した金を返せということはありますが――。』 「そうして最近支部長より中教会のほうに光明如来様をお返ししてまいりましたが、この御処置はいかがいたしましたらよろしいでしょうか」 『そのまま大事にしまっておいたらよいです。』 「中教会のほうにでございましょうか」 『支部のほうで預ればよいです。いずれ目が覚めてくることがあるだろうから、そのときまで預っておけばよいです。』 ６ 死亡した人の御神体はいかがすべきや 〔 御光話（S24年11・12月） 『御光話録』16号、昭和25(1950)年1月20日発行〕 ――信者がなにかの理由でお道から離れた場合や、信者が死亡して家族に信仰心のない場合などには、御写真、御神体、御書体などはどのようにさせていただいたらよろしいでしょうか。 『これは本人とか遺族とかの意志に任せればいいんですよ。』 ――譲っていただいてもよろしいでしょうか。 『結構ですね。』 ――信者が死亡いたしました場合、御守りは死体と一緒に火葬にするようにとうけたまわりましたが、土葬の場合にはいかがでしょうか。 『これも遺族の希望によればいいんですがね。しかし、まあ、土葬のときは一緒に埋めずに外しておいたほうがいいですね。』 ――それを御額に表装してもよろしいでしょうか。 『ええ、結構ですね。』 十二、千手観音様 １ 千手観音様を出された目的 〔 御垂示（S26年8月8日） 『御垂示録』1号、昭和26(1951)年9月15日発行〕 「最近アパートとか社宅で信者ができますが、なにか御神体をいただけないものでございましょうか」 『それはね、ちょうど千手観音様がありますから、あれならどこでも良いからね。』 ２ 洋館に御神体を祀る場合 〔 御垂示（ S27年2月**日) 『御垂示録』7号、昭和27(1952)年3月10日発行〕 「外人の入信者で、床の間がございません。御神体をお祀りすることができませんが――」 『そんなことはないですよ。一番良いところに祀るのはね。壁に枠をつけてね。千手観音さんがあるでしょう。』 十三、其 の 他 １ 光明の御文字が白く浮き出した事について 〔 妙智之光（地上天国３号） 、昭和24(1949)年4月20日発行〕 「光明の御軸を拝んでると床の左壁に光明の文字が白く浮き出します。そのわけをお教えください。」 『私の書いた絵や文字から光が出るのを見る人はたくさんある。事実光が出るのである。その文字の通りの光が出て光が文字の意味通りの働きをする。この説明はいまの科学的頭では理解できない。私が光と書いた紙を懐に入れると光の働きをして、それが腕を通って放射し病気が治る。私が字を書くと私の手から光が筆を通って紙に印象されるわけである。それは私の腹には光の玉があって、その光が手を通る、またこの玉は観音様から出る、観音様はまたその上の神様から出る。私が大光明如来と書くと大光明如来の働きをする。これはごく簡単な説明で詳しく説明するとまず霊界の構成から説明しなくては判らない。この説明はいずれ著書でする、いまはこの程度で我慢してもらう。』 ２ 停電中、御神体に観音様のお姿が表れた例 〔 御光話（S24年4月特輯号） 『御光話録』6号、昭和24(1949)年4月23日発行号〕 ――先日、私の教導所で御神体の例祭をいたしました際、夜八時、お祭り終了と同時に停電になりましたところ、御軸にはっきりと観音様の御姿がお現われになり、私はありがたく拝ませていただきました。これはいかなる意味でしょうか。 『意味がありますよ。これはこういう奇蹟を、観音様がわざわざ見せてくださるんです。その御軸は、光明如来様の「おかけじ〔御文字〕」でしょう。ええ、だから文字でも御姿をお見せくださるということをお知らせくださって、人間をより信じさせてくださるわけです。人間て奴はなかなか信じないからね、神様はお手数がかかるんだけどしかたがない。』 ３ 重病の子供の上に御神体を拡げて治った例 〔 御垂示（S26年10月1日） 『御垂示録』3号、昭和26(1951)年11月25日発行〕 「子供が死の予言のようなことを自分自身で言いまして『死んでどうするんだ』と聞きますと『天国に行くんだ』『帰れないよ』と言うと『生まれ変わるよ。どこに生まれ変わろうかな』と言うのでございます。その前に『靴を買ってあげよう』と言うと『僕いらない』と申します。それは誰が言わせているのでございましょうか」 『正守護神です。』 「浄化が強く、浄霊をしてもおさまらないので、脈もなくなるし、顔色もなくなってしかたがないので、余ってあります光明如来様を病人の上に拡げましたところが治りました」 『お祀りしてない――余分の御神体なら良いですよ。しかし、それは浄霊する人の霊力が弱いんです。拡げなくても巻いたままお腹の上にのせても良いです。お願いしてね。いまの――力を入れないやり方だと、そんなことをしなくても治るわけですがね。』 ４ 光明如来様をお祀りした部屋に入ると芳香がするが 〔 妙智之光（地上天国２号） 、昭和24(1949)年3月1日発行〕 「光明如来様をお祭りしてあるお部屋へ入ると、麝香（じゃこう）よりも線香よりも、ずっといい匂いがする。特に立派な 先生のお宅の御奉斎の間へ入るといっそう強く感じますが、いかなるわけでしょうか。」 『神霊はなんとも言えぬいい匂いのするものである。匂いというのは真善美のうち、美のうちに入るので、天国や極楽などは芳香に満ちているものである。』 ５ 船に御屏風をお祀りするのは 〔 御光話（S23年 5月28日） 『御光話録』発行年月日不明、推定昭和26年頃。〕 ――船の中へ御屏風をお祀りするのはいかがでしょうか。 『船の中へ祀るのはいけない。船の親方が、御光をいただけば船全体が守られる。田圃なんかでも、それを持っている人（支配権のある人）が御光をいただけばそれから光が田圃のほうへ行くから収穫も多いようになります。』 ６ 船に御書体をかけてよいか 〔 妙智之光（地上天国13号） 、昭和25(1950)年2月20日発行〕 「住居にお軸をお祀り申し上げるとともに、その人所有船の船長室にも、なにか御書体をおかけしてお祀りいたしてよろしいものでしょうか。」 『船に祀ってはいけない。船は必ず人間が甲板などで踏むことになるから御無礼になる。従って船長が御守り様をいただいておればそれでよい。』 ７ 御神前でお通夜をしても宜しき事 〔 御垂示（S28年5月1日） 『御垂示録』20号、昭和28(1953)年5月15日発行〕 「お通夜の場合に、祭壇は御神前でよろしいのでございましょうか」 『結構です。』 「その場合、御写真、御神体には何かおかけすべきものでしょうか」 『かけないで、そのままのほうがよいのです。やっぱり霊が救われます。』 ８ 五秘仏観音 〔 御光話（S23年 8月18日） 『御光話録』発行年月日不明、推定昭和26年頃。〕 『この御軸は今日初めてかけた。昭和七年、いまから十六年前に画いたのですが、ずっとしまっておいたのです。白髪の観音様はこれだけです。上下のは四天王であり、周りの薄墨は夜の世界を表わしています。この御軸を今日ここにおかけするとは思いませんでした。神様のすることは深遠です。この建物の用材も終戦ごろ秋田の神社の神木であったのを買ったんです。』 ９ 観音講の人に御神体の奉斎を許された例 〔 御光話（S25年 4月13日） 『御光話録』19号、昭和25(1950)年6月13日発行〕 ――観音講の連中がお道のことを聞き、光明如来様を新しい御堂に御奉斎申し上げたいと希望いたしておりますがよろしいでしょうか。 『ええ、お祀りしてもいいですよ。』 ――そこは平常は人が住んでおりませんが。 『ええ、住んでなくてもかまいませんよ。ただ粗末にさえしなけりゃいいです。お祀りすれば御利益がありますよ。』 10 死ぬ時托された観音様について 〔 御垂示（S27年5月1日） 『御垂示録』9号、昭和27(1952)年5月15日発行〕 「お姿の観音様をいただかれていた人で、私にお預りしてくれと言って他界いたしました。少し染みが入っておりますが、いかがいたしましたらよろしいでしょうか」 『それは私の方に寄付して下さい。私がもらっておきます。私が欲しいんですよ。で、絵のは――あれはもう拝んではいけないんです。やっぱり今の文字でなければね。』 11 御神体をお祀りする迄観音様のお姿や彫刻に善言讃詞を奏げるのは 〔 御垂示（S26年9月8日） 『御垂示録』2号、昭和26(1951)年10月10日発行〕 「未入信ですが、なにかとありがたがっており、観音様のお姿や彫刻に向かって善言讃詞を奏げさせていただいて良いかということでございますが、すぐに光明如来様をお祀りない、非常に困っている人です」 『まあーいいです。その代り、無論光明如来様をお祀りするまで、なにか拝みたいという意味でさせるんです。』 12 お供え物を信者にお分けする時の心得 〔 御光話（S24年 1月 8日） 『御光話録』3号、昭和24(1949)年2月8日発行〕 ――神様にお供えしてあるものをその場から信者にお分けするのはいかがでしょうか。 『信者に与えることは結構です。しかしお供えしたままではなく一応お下げしてから与えて、これはお供えしたものだと言って上げたらいいでしょう。……お供え物もそう長く上げておく必要はありません。十分か十五分でもいいし、お供えして拝んでしまったらじきに下げてしまってもいいです。仏壇にお供えする場合も同じです。』

――― 関 連 出 版 物 ――― 中島一斉先生 ――その信仰と生涯―― 麻生 鋭 三十八 先生は、折り目の正しい人であった。 何かのことでいら立って、畳針で自分の頭を突き刺したこともあるくらい激情的な性格ではあったが、折り目は正しくしていた。からだごとどしんとぶつかっ て行く人であったが、そうかと言って、八方破れの構えなど出来る人ではなかった。また、しようとはしなかった。いつも、ある程度の威儀を正すことを忘れな かった。 例えば、浄霊をして、病人を治すと、そのあと先生は、必ず大先生にお礼に行った。 東山荘の参拝の日であった。 先生は、大先生に、 「Ｙをお救い下さいまして、有難うございます」と言うなり、涙をぽろぽろ落とした。 大先生は、うしろに坐っている男を見て、 「Ｍ。おまえも治ったか」と訊いた。 その時も、先生は、そのＭと一緒に頭を下げて、心からお礼を言った。まだ、頬に、涙が光っていた。 大先生が絹の時は、先生は木綿を着た。 「大先生が木綿なら、自分は紙を着る」と先生は言った。 これも、先生の「折り目」である。 神は順序なりということも、先生にとっては、厳粛な折り目であった。 だから、布教上の報告ということについては、先生は、非常にやかましかった。 ある分会長が、結婚の媒酌人を頼まれたことがあった。 その日、結婚式場へ行かなければならなかったので、布教上の報告を助手に頼んで、出かけた。 命令された通り、助手はその報告を、先生に差し出したのであるが、先生にはそれが気に入らなかった。 翌日、その分会長が、先生のところへ行くと、先生は大立腹であった。 「それからというものは、私は、絶対に媒酌はやらないことに決めたのです。そういうことで報告がおろそかになると、又々先生から怒鳴りつけられますから ね。とにかく、先生は、折り目、折り目をきちんとしないと怒りましたね。それくらいだから、先生自身は、いつも折り目正しくしていましたよ。少なくとも、 カミシモを着る時は、ちゃんと着ていましたね」 その分会長は、こりたという顔をして、こう言っていた。 折り目が正しいということは、言い換えれば、あいまいさが嫌いということである。 自分の心があいまいな時は、誰も先生の顔をまともには見られなかった。その大きな目が恐ろしかった。 先生には、誰も嘘をつく気にはなれなかったが、それよりも、誰も嘘をつくことが出来なかった。自然、正直になった。 先生も、嘘はつかなかった。いや、つこうと思っても、つけない人なのであった。まるで子供のように、底抜けに正直であった。 「相手の身になって考えろ」 先生は、よくこう言った。 箱根の参拝日。その日は、雨だった。 若い助手のＢさんは、熱海の本部を出る時、誰かの傘を借りて出かけた。 さて、用事が終って、帰り道で気がつくと、自分の持っている傘に、「中島」と書いてある。 （あっ。先生の傘だ。まちがわないように、ちゃんと傘立に傘を置いといたのに、これは又どうしたまちがいだろうか。弱ったな。だが、これは、自分のほうでまちがえたのではない。誰かがまちがえたのだ） Ｂさんは、そう自分の心に言いきかせた。 そして、そのまま熱海へ帰って来た。 あとから戻って来た先生は、傘立に自分の傘がないので、他の人の傘を借りて来たと言った。 Ｂさんは、首をすくめて、 「傘をまちがえたのは、私です。どうもすみませんでした」とあやまった。 すると、先生は、「おまえには、誠がない」と言って、奥へ入って行った。 （誠がない？それは、どういう意味だろうか） Ｂさんは、いろいろ考えてみた。しかし、どうもよくその意味がつかめなかった。 一カ月ぐらい考えた。そして、やっとわかった。 「私が傘をまちがえて持ってきてしまったため、先生がその傘を探す時間だけ、それだけ先生の時間を無駄にさせてしまったのですね。先生の時間は、大事な 時間で、言うならば神様の時間です。それを知っていながら、まちがえた傘をさして、そのまま箱根から熱海まで帰って来てしまったのです。まちがったと知っ たら、何故箱根で、先生にその傘を渡さなかったのだろうと思って、自分の至らないのが恥かしくなりました。先生に、大事な神様の時間を無駄にさせてしまっ て……ああ、誠がないとはこのことだなと、やっと気がついたわけでした」 Ｂさんは、こう言ってから、 「先生は、その場で説明してしまわないで、あとで本人によく考えさせるという手を使う人でした」とつけた。 先生が、大勢の信者を前にして、話をする。 すると、信者の一人一人が、これは特に私だけに下さる教えだと思う。 これも、先生が、「相手の身になって考える」人であったからであろう。 三十九 「おれは、人をつくるのだ」 これが、先生の信念であった。 先生は、どんな人にも、どんな時にも、全力を出して道を説いた。 このことは、捕らえられて獄にあった吉田松陰が、獄の格子の向こうにいる獄卒に、じゅんじゅんと道を説いたという――その話を思い出させる。 そして、先生は、人を教える時には、時間もなにも忘れた。 「本当の話はこれからだ」と先生が言うので、時計を見たら、真夜中の十二時。そういうことが、しばしばあった。 だから、終るのが明け方の三時、四時になることも珍しくなかった。教えるなら、トコトンまで教える。そのため、あまり一生懸命になって、却って誤解されるということもあった。 弟子たちを集めて、三日も徹夜で説きつづけたこともあった。 昼間は忙しく飛び歩き、用事が片づくと、それから話を始める。そして、夜を徹して話し続け、雨戸のすきから朝日がさし込んで来るまでやめない。 弟子たちは、一人残らずグロッキーになってしまう。先生は、平気な顔をしていた。 ある人に嫁を世話したいという話があった。貰おうか、どうしようかと迷っていた。 すると、仲人が、 「その娘は、一年間、中島先生のところで働いていました」と言った。 その人は、その一言で、娘を貰うことに決めた。 「一年間も、先生のところで働いていれば、無条件で貰えますよ」とその人は、あとで同じ信者に言った。 「先生のところにいると、みんな人間が変ってしまう。先生は、人間改造の名人でしたね」と言った人もある。 まことに、先生には、ぼんやり話すということはなかった。ぼんやり読むということもなかった。 何事にも真剣、全力であった。 その気魂と情熱で、人をつくって行った。 しかし、先生は、決して雄弁ではなかった。むしろ、咄〔拙〕弁のほうであった。けれども、そのとつとつとして話す、その話しの魅力は、たいしたものであった。いつのまにか、みんな引きずり込まれてしまうのであった。 人をつくるために、先生は、あらゆる手を用いた。炭のつぎ方、醤油の使い方まで、その材料となった。 「神様のご用をするということは、それは大変なことなのだ、茶碗一つ片づけることだって、仇おろそかには出来ないのだ」 台所仕事などはつまらないと考えていたある女に、先生は、こう言った。 昭和二十二年のある日。復員してきたＤさんは、本部の光明の間の入口のところに坐って、先生の顔をまたたきもしないで見守っていた。軍隊にいた時と同じように、相手から目をそらすと叱られると考えて、じっと穴のあくほど見つめていた。 その時、一人の娘が、茶を持って入って来た。しかし、先生の顔を見守っているＤさんは、それに気がつかない。 入口で、娘はもじもじしている。 それを見た先生は、Ｄさんを指して言った。 「入口に坐っている人間は、出世しない。出入りの邪魔になることが気がつかない人間だからだ。人は始終あたりに気を配っていなくてはならない」 勿論、Ｄさんは、顔を赤くして縮まってしまった。 「信仰の目的は、完全な人間になるために、一歩一歩修養を積んで行くいことだ。それには、常に謙虚であり、親切であり、社会の幸福を願う下座の業を積んで行かなければならない」 こう先生は、言っていた。 口で教えるばかりではなく、先生は、せっせと原稿を書いた。すこしの暇でもあると、書いていた。真夏でも、汗を垂らし垂らし書いた。信者から沢山の手紙が来るが、書けるだけは、その返事を書くように努めた。 しかし、いちいち全部の返事は、到底書いていられない。と言って、受け取ったということぐらいは知らせたい。 そこで、先生は葉書に、毛筆で「真」の一字を書き、その下に「一斎」と書いたものを幾枚も書き溜めて置いて、それを、「手紙見た」という返事として出すのであった。 忙しくて、新聞を読む時間もないことが多い。そういう時、先生は見出しの上にシルシをつけて置いて、夜おそくなってから、助手に読んで貰った。 寝るのは、早くて十二時。遅い時は、二時、三時ということも珍らしくなかった。 四十 昭和十六年六月三十日。 先生は、大先生のお供をして、伊勢神宮に参拝した。 出発の前、大先生は、 「中島、おまえは和服ばかり着ているが、今度は洋服を着て行けよ。和服ならわしは一緒に行かんぞ」と笑いながら言った。 このため、先生は、どうしても洋服を着て行かなければならない羽目になった。 ところが、その洋服がない。 買おうと思っても、先生は背が高いから既製服では体に合うのがない。新しく仕立てさせる時間はない。 仕方なく、そのままを白状したら、大先生はやっぱり笑った。 「では、おまえは和服で行け。わしは飽くまで洋服だぞ」 さて、長い汽車の旅の中で、初めて大先生の碁の相手をした。 この時、どっちがどれだけ勝ったかは、誰も知らない。しかし、負けることの大嫌いな二人――六十才の大先生と、四十三才の先生とが喧嘩にもならず、めで たく参拝を済ませ、帰途長良川の鵜飼を楽しんだことを思えば、おそらく車中の戦いは、同点引き分けになったのだろう。 というのは、この時の手合わせが最初で、それからは毎年正月に、大先生と先生との勝負が行われたのであるが、いつも手合わせは二番だけにきまっていた。 その理由は、先生のほうが少しばかり強く、かといって二勝しては、大先生の機嫌が悪くなるだろうし、負けるのはいやだし、結局、一勝一敗ということにして、初春の大手合せはめでたく終るという寸法であった。 先生が、大先生に対して闘志を燃やすのは、たった一つ、碁の時だけであった。 四十一 先生の頭は、鼠花火のように、クルクルまわる頭であった。 考えが、先へ先へと行く。しかもそれが早い。まるで電流のようであった。 話していると、 「その次は、どうするんだ」と畳みかけて来る。 もぐもぐしていると、 「こうするつもりなんだろう」とすぐ二の矢が飛んで来る。 せっかちでもあった。 だから、話がよく飛躍する。 よほどしっかりしていないと、ついて行けない。迷子にされてしまう。 先生が、折にふれ、時に応じて語った言葉の中から、流星のような言葉――言い換えれば、素晴しい光を放っているのだが、よく気をつけて見ていないと見失ってしまうような飛躍した言葉を拾ってみる。 ある時。 「ドブに落ちている沢庵をとって来い。はっ。取って来ます。――これが兵隊だよ」 ある時。 「主師親ということを知っているか。主は応身弥勒で、大先生。師は法身弥勒で、出口王仁三郎。親は報身弥勒で、出口直先生だ」 ある時。 「ミロクの世は、いつ出来ますか」とある人が訊いた。 「昭和百年」と先生は言下に答えた。 ある時。 「天国会は、神性人間を造り出すところだ。動物人間は、住めない」 ある時。 はじめて会った人に、 「人間は誰がつくったか、知っているか」 「はあ。造物主です」 「薬は毒だが、知っているか」 「体験で知っています」 「おまえは、なかなかえらい」 ある時。 「先生だって、お守りをはずせば同じじゃないかと、あいつが言ったよ。あはははは」 ある時。 「マッチになれ」 物を燃やそうと思って、ただマッチを持って行ってもだめである。箱の中の軸木を燃やさなければならない。燃えた軸木は、どんなものをも燃やすことが出来る。人を燃やし、人を感激させるのも同じことで、まず自分が燃えて初めて可能となる。 ある時。 「風呂から上って身仕舞いをする時の気持」 先生は、女性の身嗜みについて、こう言った。この時の気持を持ち続けることが大切で、身嗜みの心構えは、この一言に尽きると言っている。 ある時。 「信仰に入っても一番になれ、そうかと言って、信仰は事業ではないのだから、魂の曇りをなくする以外に、その道はない」 ある時。 先生は、弟子たちに、宗教家としての素質があるかどうかを見分ける方法を知っているかと質問しておいて、こう言った。 「一番簡単で狂わない方法は、その人間に理想があるかないかを見ることだ。そして、次に、矛盾した世の中を見て、善悪がわかる人間であるかどうかを確かめてみることだ。その上、同情心があれば、まず大丈夫だ」 ある時。 「教師にとって一番の身魂磨きは、金と男女問題だから、それに打ち勝っていかなければならない」 終りに、一言つけ加えておく、 先生は、「教えの人」であったが、その前に「行の人」であった。きびしい修業の人であった。 このことをはっきり知っておかないと、教えの人としての先生が、ただ単に神経質な先生という印象を受け易い。 四十二 先生は、美男子であった。 瀟洒な和服が、よく似合った。 誰でもすぐ、役者を連想した。 「まさに団十郎だね」と一人の弟子が言う。 「君は団十郎を見たのか」と他の弟子が訊く。 「勿論、見ているはずはないじゃないか。しかし、とにかく団十郎だよ」 「何処が団十郎なんだ」 「君も錦絵の初代団十郎は見たことがあるだろう。あれとそっくりだ」 「そうかなあ」 「そうだとも。第一、あの目を見ろ。団十郎が目玉をむいたのと寸分違わないよ」 「先生は、いつも目をむいているわけではない」 「むいていなくても、団十郎が目玉をむいたのと同じなんだ。凄いじゃないか」 先生は、こういう内緒話を、直接耳にしたことはないかも知れない。しかし美男子であるということは、多少とも自認していたのではなかったろうか。何故なら、先生は、すべてにおいて、自信の人であったから。 その先生は、フェミニストであった。 我が強くて、横暴と見える亭主の先生も、結局はフェミニストであった。夫人には、一目も二目も置いていた。甘えん坊のようなところもあった。 何かに腹を立てて、ぷりぷりしていても、 「そんなに怒らないでもいいでしょ」と夫人になだめられると、先生の顔に、甘ったれ小僧のような表情が出て来る。 それで、夕立のあとのように、立腹も一巻の終りということがしばしばであった。 「先生は、奥さんに甘ったれている」と言った弟子もいた。 いや、怒って見せることも、実は、先生の甘ったれの表情であったかもしれない。 晩年、ようやく落ち着いた生活の中で、少量の晩酌を楽しむゆとりも出来てきた。 いかにもおいしそうに飲んだ。 しかし、時には、飲みたくないこともある。 「今夜は、いらないよ」と先生は、前もって夫人に言う。 それを夫人は、台所の手伝いに伝えるのを忘れる。 だから、晩の膳の上には、ちゃんと徳利が載せてある。 すると、先生は怒る。 「酒はいらぬと言ったじゃないか」 「そうでしたね、お台所の人に言うのを忘れました」 「おまえが悪いんだ。この酒、おまえがみんな飲んでしまえ」 こういう怒り方をするのは、一種の甘ったれ心理である。このことをよく知っていた当時の分会長が、笑いながら言った。 「内側はどうか知らないが、外側は模範的な夫婦だったという人があるが、私はその逆だよ。外側はどうか知らないが、内側は実に模範的な夫婦だったと思っ ている。しかし、これは、夫も妻も模範的な人間だからそうだったといっているのではない。お互いに弱点は持っていながら、その弱点と弱点とがぎしぎし軋し り合わずに、具合よく歯車のように噛み合って廻る――そういったよい夫婦だったと思う」 フェミニストであったから、女の信者、弟子達には、当然人気があった。それに、美男子なのであるから、人気がなかったら、それこそ不思議というものであろう。 ある時、手伝いの娘が、先生のお供をして関西へ行くことになった。 ちょうどその時、娘の友達が、やはり関西へ行くことになった。 「先生と一緒じゃ、窮屈だわ。あなたと二人、ロマンス・シートで行きたい」と娘は、その友人に言った。 このひそひそ話を、先生は聞いたかも知れないし、聞かなかったかも知れない。 先生は、その娘の友達の女に言った。 「あんただけ、先に行きなさい」 ただ、それだけ言っただけで、手伝いの娘には、なんとも言わなかった。 それが男の弟子だったら、「一緒に行きたくなければ、行くな」ぐらいの雷は落ちたにちがいない。 玉川署に留置されて、一週間目に家へ帰った先生は、出迎えた夫人に、 「どうやって食っていた？」と訊いた。 「なんとか食べていました」と言うと、 「そうか」 それっきりであった。 その先生が、便所の前で、抜けかかったパンツの紐を通して貰っている。そういう子供みたいな、愛すべき夫でもあった。 先生は、こう言った。 「人を許しましょう。相応の理ということがあって、皆、自分にふさわしい妻であり、子である。妻子を叱り飛ばす前に、一応反省しましょう。自分にも、非はあり過ぎる程あるのだ。反省と寛容、そして共に身魂を磨いてゆく――家庭の天国化は、ここに始まる」 機嫌のいい時、先生が、夫人に、 「浮気でもしてみるかな」と冗談を言う。 すると、夫人は、 「私よりいい人がいたら、いつでも遊びに行ってらっしゃい」と答える。 そして、あとは大笑いになる。 いい夫婦であった。 四十三 先生は、手紙や原稿など、すべて毛筆で書いた。 書は好きだったらしい。しかし、先生の書を、うまいという人と、むしろ下手だったという人と、半分ぐらいずつある。 ある人が、 「要するに、面白い書だよ」と言ったが、この批評が一番ぴったりしている。 短歌を、よく作った。 昭和二十四年の九月から十二月までに三冊、天国会の会報として、「天国之友」という雑誌を発行したが、それには毎号、短歌が載せてある。 今はしも滅びんとする世をあはれみて、出でましにけり救いの君はも。 師の君の御救ひなくば崩れ行く、此の日の本は如何になるらん。 夜の終りはや近めるを知らぬげに、赤のみたまの騒がしきかも。 次々に忌はしき事のみ重なるは、夜の終りの徴なりけり。 厳かな神の審判は今正に、現はれ初めけり心せよかし。 師の君の隠せる力を知りてより、凡てを捨てて我は起ちたり。 師の君の振はせ給ふ御力は、神の救ひの力と覚れり。 師の君を我若し未だ知らざれば、迷ひに迷ひ悩みつづけむ。 師の君の御力戴き吾も亦、力限りに世人医さむ。 師の君の御身のまはりの出来事は、みな大神の仕組と知れかし。 霊界の転換いよよ吾等住む、此の地の上に移り初めけり。 五と六に七の力の加はりて、絶対力は現れなんとすも。 十全の御力戴き思ふまま、世人救ふ時は近めり。 奴羽玉の闇に染まりし此の身魂、洗い浄めて神業に仕へん。 風水火三大災厄何んのその、身魂磨きて神に縋れば。 大神は正しき人に造らんと、曲とう砥石を吾に賜へり。 ある日、先生が、自作の短歌を大先生に差し出すと、大先生は笑って、 「きみのは、歌じゃないよ。漢文だよ」と笑って言った。もちろん、半分冗談であろう。 けれども、この言葉は、先生の短歌に対する批評というだけでなく、もっと大きな意味をもっている。 というのは、先生の性格には、漢文のようなところがあった。 これについて、ある人は、 「先生の故郷の土地柄だね。松陰と似ているんだ」と言った。 又、ある人は、 「遺伝かもしれない。父君は漢詩人だったし、日本外史が愛読書だったからね」と言った。 四十四 「自分にもきびしく、人にもきびしい。私は、先生を道元のような人と思った」 昭和二十四年秋、先生に初めて会ったある宗教学者が言っている。 先生は、確かに、そういう秋霜烈日のような人であった。古武士の面影があった。 しかし、一方、ユーモラスなところもあった。 ある時、ある分教会で、先生を招いて講話を聞いた。二百人ぐらい信者が集っていた。 講話が終って、先生は、演壇をはなれ、部屋から出て行こうとした。 すると、遅れて来て、一番うしろの席に坐っていた一人の娘が、 「先生。もっとよくお顔を見せて下さい」と大きな声で言った。 先生は、それを聞くと、再び演壇近くまで戻って来て、ちょっとシナをつくってみせた。 そして、こう言った。 「あたし、はずかしいわ」 こういう先生でもあったから、面白いことは遠慮なく笑った。いかにも愉快そうに、大きな口をあけて笑った。取り済〔澄〕ました顔ばかりしていなかった。 旅の列車の中で、ある人が、落語を一席やった。 先生は、腹をかかえて笑いこけた。 あとで、自分が大きな声で笑い続けたことが、ちょっとテレ臭くなったのだろう。にやりとして言った。 「しようのないやつだ」 毎月、本部に集った時に、分会の会長たちは、御讃歌の朗唱を練習する。 ある日、分会長の代理で、Ｗさんという助手が、それに出た。 出たけれども、自分は分会長ではなし、朗唱はしなくてもいいのだろうと思って、のんびり坐っていた。 ところが、先生は、 「君もやれ」と言う。 Ｗさんは、あわてた。どういう節でやっていいのかわからない。 思い切って、自分流で、朗唱し出した。 その節があまりにおもしろいので、先生は大きな声で笑った。他の連中も、どっと笑った。 それだけではない。Ｗさんの滑稽な節に感染して、あとからあとから、妙な節の朗唱が出た。 先生は、面白がって、あっはっはと笑っていた。 ある時、助手が、紙幣を重ねて、それに帯をして、何万何千円と書いた。 ところが、まちがって、千の位のところに点を打たず、百の位のところに点を打ってしまった。 それを見て、先生は、おどけて言った。 「随分沢山あるね。これは凄い！」 「お茶の作法だけはだめでした」と夫人が言っているが、先生は、なんでもやった。その先生のお得意なものに百人一首があった。 恒例として、毎年正月には、かるた会が開かれ、大先生を中心に、先生やその助手、あるいはその他の信者などが集って、賑やかなことであった。 しかし、その手並みでは、先生がズバ抜けてうまい。だから、先生の前に坐った者は、例外なく散々に負かされる。入れ替り、立ち替り、総なめにされることも多かった。 大先生も笑って、 「上の句は読まんこったな。でないと、中島にみんなとられてしまう」と言った。 他の連中は、大抵、読み手が下の句まで読んで来ないと、手も出ないのであった。 笑い冠句も盛んに作った。 大先生が宗匠格で、その笑い冠句の会は、昭和四年頃から八年頃まで続いた。 昼の弁当には、いつも、竹の皮に包んだ赤飯が出た。 先生の号が千成、夫人の号が万女子。 時には、子供たちとゲームをすることがあった。負けると、本気でくやしがった。 ピンポンをやる時でも、肌ぬぎになって、すぐムキになる。勝つまでやめない。勝てば、ご機嫌であった。 先生は、夕食のあとなど、ピアノを弾いて楽しむこともあった。「米山さんから、雲が出て……」というのが好きで、こればかりをよく弾いた。「金襴どんすの帯しめながら……」という童謡も好きだった。時には、長唄の「越後獅子」を弾く事もあった。 「どうだ。うまいものだろう」 ある人に、そう自慢してみせたら、その口の悪い男は、 「しかし、先生のはやっぱりお茶漬けピアノですね」と言った。 先生は、音楽を知らない者が何を言うかというような顔をした。 そのピアノは、戦時中、東京から買って来た。熱海まで自動車で運ぶのであるが、そのガソリンは自分で心配して調達して来た。 ピアノは、まあ及第点であったが、歌うことはカラキシだめであった。音痴の部類であった。 御讃歌の奉誦も、先生はよく側の夫人に、 「おまえ、やれよ」と言った。 そういう先生であるから、自分から歌うなどということは殆どなかった。ただ、宴会の余興などの時に、「愛染かつら」だけはよく歌った。 しかも、歌う時には、わざと中風患者の格好をして、そしていかにもロレツがまわらないという口振りで、それを歌うのであった 「先生は、歌が下手なことを百も承知しているから、それで、ああやってカムフラージュして歌うんだね」と弟子の一人が、隣の席の男に言った。 「そこが、先生の悧巧なところだ」とその男が答えた。 けれども、聞くことは好きだった。 夫人が琴を弾くのを、先生はいつも静かに、じっと聞いていた。特に「千鳥の曲」が好きであった。 先生と夫人の笑い冠句と沓句を載せて置こう。 チェッ、何が華族だ祖先は盗賊じゃねえか。（千成） 助けてくれえ、とは貧乏人じゃねえ三井、三菱様だよ。 ああたまらねえ、税金がたまらねえ。 ああたまらねえ、と助けを求める金持の後家さんはいないものかな。 ああたまらねえ、ほど溜るのは罪と、そうして便所だよ。 アン畜生、人を責める時はいい気持そう、自分が責められる時は居睡り。 奇妙奇天烈、神様にかかって助かるよりは、医者にかかって死ぬ方がマシだとよ。 妾恥しいわ、何ていう柄かい、まるで鬼子母神のような面をしやがって。 妾恥しいわ、随分目立って来たのよ、腹膜炎かしら。 フヌケ、フヌケって馬鹿にするが、これでも女房を家に囲ってあるんだぞ、ヘン。 ソーラ大変、隣の夫婦が夜中に大喧嘩だ、アアいい気持だとホクソ笑んでる独り者。 寒中胸も足も丸出しの洋装美人、続け様に、ハックショイ。（万女子） トンチキ野郎、酒と酢とを間違えて、ヤー大変。 顔形は、ヘナチョコ野郎の亭主でも、心はナカナカもって、ホホホホ。 奥様、女中にあんまりお小言がうるさいので、女中思わず、このスベタめ。 四十五へ続く
