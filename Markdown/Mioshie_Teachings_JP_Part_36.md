ADDRESS BY THE FOUNDER OF SEKAI KYUSEI KYO （真文明とはなにか 東京日比谷公会堂における講演会講話、未発表、昭和26(1951)年5月22日） Preface This volume, True Health, is a collection of the teachings on human health of Mokichi Okada, founder of Sekai Kyusei Kyo, who is known by the organization's members as Meishu-sama, or Enlightened Spiritual Leader. In its original Japanese-language form it was published as a sister volume to another collection of Meishu-sama's teachings entitled Tengoku no Ishizue (Foundation of Paradise). Of the three salient elements of the Heaven on Earth that Meishusama felt was his mission to establish － health, prosperity, and harmony － health is the most fundamental. Health, both mental and physical, has always been the foundation of all prosperity and happiness, and mankind has exerted great and repeated efforts to attain it. Sometimes the approach was spiritual and psychological, sometimes scientific and material. Out of these efforts arose movements to cure illness, the great destroyer of health, through a unified, mutually interacting and complementary physio-psychological approach. Activities oriented toward that end continue today. Medical science has, obviously enough, played the leading role in attempts to ensure physical health. Rapid strides forward in medico-therapeutic techniques, especially in recent years, have made it possible to save gravely endangered lives and to restore normal functioning to the human body. Yet in spite of such advances, not only does sickness persist, as is shown by the increase in the "diseases of civilization," but excessive medical treatment, overuse of medicines, application of chemical fertilizers and pesticides to agricultural crops, widespread use of food additives, overeating, and extensive use of narcotics have led to an increasing incidence of psychological abnormalities, deformed newborn infants, and obese or frail children. Many people continue to believe that, even though medical science clearly has negative as well as positive effects, it will eventually lead to a new era completely free of illness. But Meishu-sama has warned that if medical therapy and eating habits remain unchanged, illness itself will increase rather than decrease, even though pathological forms may change. Modern therapeutic methods mistake a temporary effect for a fundamental cure. By concentrating research solely on the physical aspects, those who advocate such methods overlook the true nature of life as comprising both spiritual and physical aspects. Meishu-sama taught that though God made human beings to be healthy, modern medicine employs unnatural methods which are detrimental rather than beneficial. Against this background of mistaken belief and practice, this compilation of Meishu-sama's teachings on the subject has been prepared in the hope of contributing to the attainment of true health for all humanity. Since Meishu-sama's health philosophy differs from generally accepted ideas, the following outline of its major principles is offered to enable the reader to understand it better. Our world has a spiritual as well as a physical aspect, and the two are as inseparably bound together as the upper and under sides of the same object. The spiritual world is indeed the generative cause, the fundamental essence, of the physical world. In other words, all phenomena occurring in the physical world have already occurred in the spiritual world and have been subsequently transferred to the world of matter. This truth is expressed in the principle that the spiritual precedes the physical. Since the spiritual and physical planes are two sides of the same entity, what happens in one affects the other. Occurrences on the spiritual plane have consequences on the physical plane, and physical phenomena influence the spiritual plane. In short, the condition prevailing in one plane comes to resemble or be identical with the condition prevailing in the other. The spiritual and physical planes are one. Similarly, the human being consists of the visible physical being and the invisible spiritual being. Phenomena occurring in the human flesh are transferred from the spirit, and changes in the physical being are reflected in the spiritual being. Although essentially transparent, the spiritual being may become clouded by impurities caused by negative thoughts, words, and deeds such as anger, hatred, envy, and slander. Impurities entering the physical body make the blood murky and reflect on the spiritual being by making it cloudy. This spiritual cloudiness is transferred as a toxin, or poison, to the physical being, where it tends to stagnate and congeal as its quantity increases. When the poison reaches a certain level, the physical body loses its ability to function normally. Then the body's natural powers of self-purification eliminate the accumulation of toxins and restore normal health. These powers of Self-purification are God's greatest blessing. Such conditions as fever, pain, coughing; accumulations of phlegm, and diarrhea represent those self-purification powers at work dissolving and expelling the toxins from the body. These powers may cause temporary physical instability, yet as time passes the toxins are expelled, purification is completed and normal health is restored. The elimination of toxins removes the corresponding clouds from the spiritual plane. Medical science, however, tends to regard these conditions as harmful and has always employed such things as medicines to cure symptoms as quickly as possible. Even where it has apparently succeeded, such treatment has halted the self-purification process midway. Since it prevents the elimination of clouds from the spiritual being and toxins from the physical being, these undesirable elements accumulate. Furthermore, the pollution of the blood with medicines reflects on the spiritual being by increasing cloudiness. This in turn amplifies the accumulation of toxin in the physical being to a still greater level and can lead to a dangerous situation. The natural self-purification powers once again strive to remove the accumulated toxin and manifest themselves in more violent forms than before. Medical science responds by prescribing stronger medicines, which halt the self-purification powers so that they once again assume still more violent forms. As the process recurs over and over again without resolution, spiritual clouds and physical toxins accumulate to the point where the self-purification forces become impotent and extremely stubborn pathological symptoms afflict the physical being. It is important to note here that not just medicines, but chemical fertilizers, pesticides and food additives fall into the category of impurities. The way to eliminate spiritual clouds and their physical manifestation in the form of toxins is through Johrei purification by means of the divine light, which God made available through Meishu-sama. Johrei entails channeling the divine light from the palm of the hand of one person toward the spiritual being of another, and thereby stimulating the process of purification and eliminating the cloudiness of the spirit and the toxins that are its manifestation in the physical being. This Johrei in turn enables the natural powers of self-purification to function normally. In addition to eliminating spiritual clouds, it is vital to avoid creating then The fundamental thing here, as already explained, is to maintain correct mental attitudes and to speak and act in a correct manner, yet at the same time it is important to minimize the amount of impurities that is allowed to enter the body by eating only pure foods raised by natural agricultural methods, or what we call "nature farming." Meishu-sama's explanation of the causes of illnesses and the way they can be eliminated is not mere theory but is based on divine revelation; on Meishu-sama's own repeated triumphant encounters with illness, some times serious enough to threaten life itself; and on innumerable other cases in which he helped people conquer illness. As Meishu-sama says in the text of this book: "I have been thoroughly instructed by God in all things pertaining to human health and illness. If I had not, I would never have undertaken the fearsome task of creating a world free of illness. I am able to speak boldly because I am absolutely certain of what I am saying" (p 11). This absolute certainty enabled Meishu-sama to criticize modern therapeutic methods. He recognized their effectiveness and their necessity under some circumstances, but insisted that they are no more than temporary palliatives or extenders of life, incapable of bringing about a fundamental cure. Reliance on such therapy not only fails to eliminate the illness under treatment, but actually complicates and aggravates it Meishu-sama Warned that should this situation go uncorrected, the health of all humankind could deteriorate and the whole species be threatened with extinction. He devoted his own life to trying to increase as much as possible the number of people who know the meaning of true good health. Meishu-sama's numerous adverse comments about modem therapy, medicines, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides in this text are something more than fault-finding and criticism. They are warnings and proposals founded on his immense spirit of compassion. "The utter misery of modern humankind brings me intolerable suffering" (p 11). We hope, thus, that the reader will examine closely the deep meaning of Meishu-sana's teachings, rather than concentrating on their surface meaning or regarding them as rigid dogma. Meishu-sama did not categorically reject all medical therapy and medication, but he did warn that in many instances medication can have adverse effects, especially when taken in excess. He also taught that, if the spiritual being is kept pure by means of Johrei, the physical being will remain in such good health that medical treatment and medicines will become Superfluous. In connection with this, in the October 15, 1950 issue (No. 17) of the monthly magazine Chijo Tengoku (Paradise on Earth), Meishu-sama stated: "There are people in our membership who say that our faith rejects doctors, medicines, injections, etc. We must be most cautious on this point. Mistaken interpretations of the aims of our organization invite general misunderstanding and are consequently harmful to our faith. I take this opportunity to warn you against giving the impression of rejecting medical therapy." Many of the teachings included in this volume were originally published long ago. At that time, while desiring to make known his new theory of health in order to help as many of the world's suffering people as quickly as possible, Meishu-sama fully realized that publishing his ideas would expose him to sharp attack, since his philosophy varied widely from commonly accepted ideas on the subject and constituted a disturbing challenge to the medical and agricultural establishments. Nonetheless, he published for the sake of the well-being of humanity. As was expected, he was criticized, attacked, and even forbidden to publish further. But many people have been helped greatly because he spoke out. In recognition of his great compassionate heart, our organization has decided to compile his teachings and publish then once again in new form. Happily, we were able to time the publication of the original Japanese-language version to coincide with the celebration of the centennial of Meishu-sama's birth and thereby express our gratitude for the blessing of his teachings. It is our profound wish that this book will increase the numbers of people, who awakened to the truth about health and to the true way of attaining it, will become sound in mind and body and will devote their efforts and sense of mission toward the establishment of that which all humanity longs for: a better world. FAITH AND HEALTH 001. The Supreme Goal No one can deny that happiness is the supreme goal of all human aspirations, and that physical health is absolutely essential both to people in search of happiness and to people who are happy and wish to remain that way. As Jesus of Nazareth said, "What does it profit a man, if he gains the whole world but loses his own life?" I have succeeded in eliminating illness from human beings and restoring them to vigorous health, thereby prolonging their lives. This signifies the achievement of a great ideal to which humanity has aspired for thousands of years. The prolonging of human life has hitherto been generally assumed to be a fool's dream. For that very reason, the great discovery leading to its realization must have value unrivaled in human history. I am certain that taking this new healing art to all humanity cannot fail to bring about a great global revolution. But this should not cause alarm: the revolution I speak of will be far removed from the bloody and violent revolutions of the past. It will be brilliant with light and joy, and will serve as the foundation for eternal peace. Though I may sound overly bold, I believe that if you read this book carefully, think deeply about its contents and put them into actual practice, you will see that there is no falsehood in what I say. What is the meaning of cultural development but the betterment of the well-being of each individual? The basis of this well-being must be health and longevity. As we all know, humanity has exerted great efforts to advance in the field of medical science, in the belief that this is the only way that this goal can be achieved. It is certainly true that medical science has a glamour unequalled by any other science. But human beings tend to be dazzled by the great hospitals with their surgical theaters, countless kinds of medicines, microscopes, X-ray equipment, radium, and various radiation devices, by the minutely worked out scientific theories, the frequent new discoveries; and the publication of new theories. Because of all of this impressive paraphernalia, human beings naturally assume that medicine can ultimately eliminate illness. Yet today that goal remains in the remote future, and we have no idea when it will be achieved. I do not wish to idly criticize medical science, yet I feel that it is time to warn the world that we are still moving in a direction opposed to what ought to be the true goal. In clarifying the functioning of the human body by means of dissection and analysis, medical science has performed a service for which we must be grateful Yet that same medical science is in many ways fallacious indeed, it is surely one of the wonders of the world that humanity should have gone so long without recognizing those fallacies. The healing art I have created represents the opening of a mystical door that has been closed for thousands of years. I believe that God has entrusted to me the great task of helping to restore humanity to its essential state of good health. February 5, 1947 002. Curing the Whole by Curing the Parts Let us consider for a moment the actual situation prevailing in the world. The reign of the irrational is wellnigh universal; truth is rarely, if ever, to be encountered. For this reason there is no telling when the suffering of humanity will be eliminated. In brief, the world as a whole as well as individual countries, is sick. Though it seems immense, the world is only a collection of individuals. The illness of one person is transferred to the whole nation and then to the world until the entire globe is in a pathological condition. Yet the reverse, too, is true: if the individual becomes healthy and sound, so will the nation and ultimately, the world. A person who understands this principle sees that promoting the health of individuals is the sole way to － as our motto proclaims － create an ideal world. In other words, curing the illness of individual after individual is the way to achieve this great goal. June 25, 1951 003. My Single Suffering I, too, have my sufferings. Since my task is to blaze a new trail in a bleak and lightless world such as that of the present, Satan and Devadatta (a cousin and disciple of the Buddha who turned against, and even plotted the death of his master; he has come to be a symbol of evil) run rampant. It is like being surrounded by a wall bristling with the spears of jealousy, envy, persecution, calumny, and misunderstanding. Trying to overcome these things and gradually turn this hellish world toward paradise is more difficult than can be imagined. Nevertheless, since I enjoy the protection of the Supreme Spirit my lot is not so hard as it may appear to outsiders; indeed, I an constantly grateful for the great happiness and wonderful destiny that have been vouchsafed me. Nonetheless, there is one thing that causes me great suffering. It is, as might be expected, related to modern medical science. Though I have been speaking and writing about the fallacies of modern medicine for many years, I have never yet gone ahead and told the complete, unvarnished truth. I have been careful always to avoid unduly provocative remarks, since I felt that to reveal the whole truth might cause unnecessary trouble. Furthermore, however I might have wished to publish the truth, I was unable to do so until the right time had come. I have been thoroughly instructed by God in all things pertaining to human health and illness. If I had not, I would never have undertaken the awesome task of creating a world free of sickness. I am able to speak boldly because I am absolutely certain of what I am saying. Since the basis of eliminating suffering is eradicating illness, the utter misery of modern humanity brings me intolerable suffering. I am caught between my sympathy for humanity's plight and the feeling that the time is not right for speaking the full truth. This has caused me such great pain that I have constantly prayed for the speedy arrival of the day for full revelation. June 3, 1950 004. Health and Heaven on Earth As you already know from my repeated explanations, the ideal world that we constantly advocate entails the elimination of humankind's three greatest sufferings: illness, poverty, and conflict. Illness is obviously the main condition from which the other two sufferings arise. If God wishes to save humankind, He must begin by solving the problem of health. Without health, what happiness can there be? Any religion or science that lacks the power to solve the issue of health is of little value, since it is impossible to deal with poverty or conflict without good health. This is probably the first tine that any religion, or science, has taken up the cause of creating a world free of illness, poverty, and conflict. To set such a goal requires enormous confidence, yet the fact that we have been able to attract hundreds of thousands of faithful followers in a short time, and that the number of those followers is gradually increasing as time passes indicates that this confidence was not unfounded. It is essential that all ills be eliminated. Throughout the development of our organization, therefore, we have recognized the need to deal with the issue of health, and have given first precedence to healing. To bring the results to as many people as possible, we have filled the pages of our periodicals with case histories, which inevitably awakens doubt in the minds of readers, especially scholars and specialists. Since almost all of these case histories represent miracles of a kind that are usually thought impossible, specialists and people in positions of political responsibility naturally expect thorough investigations of then. Such people are likely to see in the results expressed in our testimonials a threat of unprecedented problems. They wonder, perhaps, whether many of our testimonials are true. If they are in fact free of exaggeration and falsehood, what can they mean? Unprecedented as it is in the history of the world, the issue is so difficult that such people have no idea how to approach it Yet facts always remain facts; truth is always truth. We would not willingly be foolish enough to hurl ourselves into a whirlpool that is certain to drag us into major problems. Yet if one views the matter objectively, one sees that it is Time, the absolute authority, that has brought forth this great undertaking, in which we cannot help but recognize a tremendous love. How will the ordinary people interpret those well-documented cases of individuals, who, despairing after having tried in vain all kinds of accepted therapies in the hope of curing their grave illnesses, coming to know Johrei, and experiencing the joy of returning to life from the brink of death, are unable to express their gratitude in words? People who doubt and reject these experiences have never actually come into contact with the matter in question. It is only rational for human beings to use the power of Johrei in eliminating the suffering of the world, if thorough investigation proves beyond doubt that our experiences are fact. Anyone who persists in refusing to recognize the truth even after it is conclusively proved must either be lacking in love for humanity, be forced to adopt this Stand by inescapable circumstances, or be psychologically ill. Perhaps what I have said is too outspoken; but the plea I make is one we cannot ignore as long as we intend to go forward into the new age. June 25, 1949 005. A World Without Illness, Poverty, and Conflict Most People regard a world without illness, poverty, and conflict as an unattainable ideal but our movement is not afraid to say that it believes firmly in its realization. The fundamental way to create such a world is to eliminate illness. People who become ill must spend money on treatment and may be forced to stay away from work. Misfortunes pile on misfortunes as the illness continues. Ultimately, all the savings and property the individual worked and sweated for years to amass are gone. Then, when he has borrowed all he can from friends and relatives, he finds that no trace remains of the abundant, peaceful, and happy way of life he and his family enjoyed until only recently. There are many cases of people who, sinking to the lowest possible depths, suffer from both illness and poverty. The entire family of a person who is gravely ill is obliged to shoulder limitless responsibilities. One person's illness can cause hardship to some degree or other, not only to relatives and friends, but also to employers and fellow workers. One person's illness can be a blow to the four or five people in his or her immediate family and to others outside the home as well. When two or three people fall terminally ill, one after the other, in the same household, it is not uncommon for even the wealthiest family to find itself compelled to live in severely reduced circum stances. People save money with one of two aims; the positive aim of amassing property and a fortune, and the negative aim of providing funds to pay medical bills in case of illness. As everyone is aware, a very great number of people save for the latter, negative purpose. We can conclude that illness is the greatest cause of poverty. Everyone knows that the fundamental causes of conflict, whether on the individual or on the national scale, are economic. As I have already said, illness is a basic cause of economic trouble. Consequently, in order to rid the world of poverty and conflict it is essential first to eliminate the fundamental cause － illness. First priority must go to ridding humanity of sickness. Only a divine power could achieve such an aim; not even the Buddha or Jesus Christ dreamed of such a glorious undertaking, and whoever can have faith in its realization is a happier man than any before him. September 15, 1935 006. Health is Everything Theologians and journalists are mistaken when they insist that those religions which stress the cure of illness － or the promotion of good health － are somehow inferior because they concentrate on practical benefits. Illness is a tremendous hindrance to society as well as a cause of great suffering, and a thorough examination of contemporary society shows that sickness is the fundamental cause of all unhappiness and tragedy. It can even be said that there is illness behind every tragedy. The number of happy people increases in direct proportion to an increase in the number of healthy people. I have been speaking on the individual level, but on the national level, as well, there is nothing as negative as illness, the root of all troubles. In the achievement of the supreme goal － a world free of illness, poverty, and conflict － solving the problem of illness leads to the solution of the problems of poverty and conflict. It is important to remember that illness means not only physical, but also psychological disorders, one of the most serious issues in the world today. War provides a good illustration. The people who instigate wars are the exact opposite of the people who try to prevent them. Similarly, the ringleaders in aggression are very different from the people who must be urged to fight. The great villains in these instances are always the people of power who set war in motion, and exposure of their true motives always shows that they are greedy and unsatisfied with the degree of success ordinary people find sufficient. Their extraordinary talents and self-confidence make then impatient and spur them on to outrageous ambition. As the lives of historical heroes make clear, such people invariably end up in failure even though things may go their way for a while. Furthermore, for the sake of achieving their own ambitious ends, they mercilessly sacrifice the lives of many ordinary people. Even though they are called heroes, such people are in fact able to remain unperturbed in the face of the horrifying unhappiness and loss of life they cause, the reason being that they themselves are psychologically flawed. They suffer from a kind of madness; obviously, there is something mentally wrong with a person who is able to persist in selfish, loveless, merciless actions that serve his or her own purposes regardless of the cost to others. Interestingly enough experience has taught me that a person with a psychological flaw always has some kind of physical flaw as well. The reason why some "heroes" and criminals seen to enjoy extreme good health is that, though they harbor large quantities of toxins, these are in a solidified state. On the basis of this discussion, it might seem that any religion, science, philosophy, or educational system that eliminated human illness would be acceptable. In fact, however, there is no way to cure sickness completely but through the Divine Light. November 12, 1952 007. Heaven through Health Jesus Christ proclaimed: "the kingdom of heaven is at hand." Undoubtedly, it is the goal of all religions to create a better world, to relieve humanity of suffering, and to bring about a world of joy. However, far from realizing this common goal, we have not yet even broken out of the hell on earth. Why is it that, in spite of the ceaseless efforts of religion, philosophy, science, morality, and education in all parts of the world from ancient times, we have made so little progress? We have still to see the first glimmerings of a solution to the problem of health that lies at the heart of all tragedy. Unless the problem of health is solved, it will be meaningless to try to set the other things right. The divine spiritual healing that I have perfected is capable of eliminating all human illness and of establishing perfect health. Nevertheless, the discovery of this divine spiritual healing readily invites misunderstanding. The relation between it and the majority of the world is like that between people standing on the ground and a man standing on a roof. The people on the ground cannot see the top of the head of the man located on the roof. Be sure that if you seek the cause of any tragedy, you will find illness at its heart. Take, for instance, the case of a young person who, on the verge of graduating from a school of higher learning, is afflicted with tuberculosis.* Hope vanishes both for the student and for the parents who centered all their aspirations in him. Their future is dark. Similarly, a middle-aged person attacked by some dread disease must stop working in frustration just at the time when he or she has laid the foundation for vigorous future activity. As I have said, most of the tragedies of human society can be traced to illness. It is just at this most miserable of times that there has suddenly appeared divine spiritual healing. Anyone who has joined our organization and has actually experienced it will be convinced of just how revolutionary a medical science it is. April 20, 1950 *"At the time that this article was written, tuberculosis was still a dreaded and generally incurable disease in Japan." 008. The Road to Happiness All human beings wish for happiness, and it is obvious that freedom from illness is essential for the happiness of individuals and families. But the idea of complete good health has been considered impossible until now, and many people, though healthy, live in the fear of falling ill sooner or later. Moreover, this anxiety is aggravated by uncertainty as to whether such an illness could be cured. For these reasons, even successful people in comfortable circumstances cannot enjoy true happiness because of the insecurity they feel about their health. As I have explained frequently before, illness is the fundamental source of all unhappiness. People save money and buy health and life insurance to provide for themselves when they become sick. Similar motivation is behind many social institutions such as orphanages, homes for the elderly, and relief funds. Consequently, until the problem of human illness is solved, even the most ideal governmental measures cannot bring people true happiness. In brief, health is the basis of happiness － indeed, is all of happiness － but no medical art or method has so far been able to solve the problem of sickness, until now. I am not boasting; but, as I have already stated, the Johrei and health regimen that I have founded can liberate humanity from the insecurity caused by sickness. I can say with certainty that any person who comes to know Johrei will experience true happiness. The road is already open to the happiness for which human beings have longed for thousands of years. September 28, 1942 009. With Faith and Without Faith Firstly, I must make it clear that by the word "faith" I mean, specifically, faith in our teachings and not faith in the general sense. The people living in this transient world of suffering are aptly described in Christ's words as "pathetic lambs." How many people can actually be said to live out their days completely free of anxiety? Among the factors causing human insecurity, illness is the most important. People cannot foretell when they will become ill. People can catch a cold within an hour of being perfectly sound in health. The cold can develop into pneumonia, or the early stages of tuberculosis. An attack of appendicitis may bring agonizing pain at any time. The next day, that person may come down with intestinal typhus or some unknown disease. Within two or three days, a child may die of such dread diseases as infantile dysentery, diphtheria, or meningitis. Elderly people can become bedridden and miserable for years from a sudden cerebral hemorrhage resulting in palsy or partial paralysis. A member of the family may be forced to lead a life of isolated hospitalization because of a highly contagious illness. Moreover, in these days of high medical costs, it is impossible to foresee how much therapy and hospitalization will cost If the illness is easily cured, the situation is not too bad, but if the illness is protracted, hard-earned savings may be totally exhausted, positions may be lost as a result of long absence from the job, and all financial support may vanish. As long as the person recovers and is able to work, he or she can make a living, but how is a family to make ends meet if the head of the house either dies or becomes permanently disabled? Such a fate means the end of all undertakings and plans. It is especially hard when such tragedy strikes a person in the prime of life. Who can say that the tragic day will not come when, as a consequence of illness and death, the bonds of love between husband and wife or parent and children must be severed? As reflection on these considerations proves, all human beings, without exception, bear the fear of illness like a leaden weight If humanity cannot be liberated from this anxiety, then the Buddha was correct in saying that the transient world is like a house on fire, and that no one can escape the four sufferings of birth, illness, aging, and death. According to the Buddha, it is the realization and acceptance of this that constitutes enlightenment. What more wonderful news for humanity could there be, then, than the appearance of a teaching capable of liberating it from the anxiety of illness! At first, anyone proclaiming the advent of such a teaching would no doubt be ridiculed as claiming the impossible and as being one step short of madness. Nonetheless, such a teaching has most certainly appeared. My readers may entertain nagging doubts, may reject what I say － yet if true it is surely enough to create a worldwide sensation. I shall now briefly explain the relation between faith in our teachings and illness. Anyone who grasps the essence of this faith has no fear of illness. Once its causes are clearly understood, illness is seen as a source of happiness rather than fear, since it is recognized as a natural physiological process in the advancement of good health and therefore as one of God's great blessings. So far, I have concentrated on illness, but many other sources of anxiety make it impossible for contemporary people to enjoy even a moment's tranquility. For instance, vehicular transportation, on which so many people rely and in which they spend so large a part of their lives is frequently the source of serious disasters. Similarly, disaster due to dangerous machinery at places of work, fire, theft, or earthquakes, floods and other natural occurrences can, like the principal danger of sickness, strike at any time. Governments and private bodies take steps to protect the population against these things, and funds are set up to provide health insurance, disaster insurance, unemployment insurance, and so on. However, none of these tangible methods can ensure tranquility beyond a certain limit. Absolute security can be attained only with intangible insurance; that is, God's insurance. Modern people, who are truly "pathetic lambs," and highly unreceptive to the idea of intangible methods, find themselves trapped in constant anxiety, since the tangible means on which they rely can do nothing to solve the basic problem. Those of us who have this understanding cannot bear to watch those without it, who, like rootless grasses, live lives of fear and trembling. They are like people afloat on the sea in a lifeboat, being intent only on their own vessel, they refuse to acknowledge the existence of the great ship that has drawn close with an invitation to board. Looking on and offering help, we are still unable to draw them from the darkness of rejection. It is understandable, of course, that people find it difficult to accept this wonderful, but totally unprecedented spiritual power. Nonetheless, the very appearance of this great teaching removes all ground for doubt that the emergence of an ideal world, a world free of illness, poverty, and conflict is at hand. March 20, 1949 010. Sekai Kyusei Kyo and Myself As all members understand, our religion is quite different from all preceding religions. Though I cannot give a detailed explanation here, I should like to describe the difference briefly. Most religions in Japan are of one or two general kinds. The first kind, which is so simple as almost to fall outside the category of religion, entails actions and ceremonies that give the performer no more than a vague sense of having done the right thing. From time to time, believers in such religions visit shrines, where they buy talisman plaques, amulets or fortune-telling papers. Those with money may sponsor performances of ritual dancing. Others toss money into the shrine offering box or make other contributions. Doing these things gives them a vague sense of spiritual security. In Japan, this kind of popular faith is called "Belief in the Gods." Since a corresponding organization is usually behind it, it can only be called a "religion." The second kind is a pure religion in which members are registered and organized into groups, and in which numerous officers, ministers and missionaries engage exclusively in religious work. Firm believers in such religions have a sincerity that, in contrast to any vague sense of "grace," inspires them to throw themselves enthusiastically, body and soul, into religious activities. The second kind of religion occurs in both old and new forms. Perhaps under the influence of the changing times, the older ones are less vigorous and tend to stagnate. I hear that, by now, some of them barely manage to survive at all. The newer ones (again in Japan) have come into being since the late nineteenth century and are currently developing with great vigor. Most of them, however, are related to the Shinto faith. Among the Buddhists, only some groups within the Nichiren Sect demonstrate vigor. The rest lack vitality. Though differing from each other in forms and modes, most of these religions are extension of the ideas or writings of their founders. Their believers serve sincerely because they enjoy the protection of the god or Buddha whom their religion reveres. Obviously, however, degrees of intensity of faith vary among members. Most of them claim to want to make humans happier and the world a better place. We are in agreement with them in this, but many religions concentrate too much on spiritual elements and show relatively little interest in material benefits to be obtained in this life. 011. The True Salvation While not neglecting the psychological aspects, we realize that, without consideration of physical aspects as well, relief cannot be complete. This basic stand is what sets our organization apart from all others. Spiritual salvation alone is a theoretical matter that cannot give true happiness. Purely psychological happiness can vanish at any moment in our deteriorating modern society. Illness may strike; thieves may break in and steak swindlers may cause financial loss, or heavy tax burdens may bring grave difficulty. Of course, taxes are necessary if police and courts of law are to deal with criminals. Money must be spent in the prevention of the many sicknesses to which human beings fall victim, and money must be found through taxation to make up for the huge losses incurred in wars started by ill-minded men. Many other instances could be cited, but as these show, it is extremely difficult to live in security and tranquility on the basis of spiritual salvation alone. In short, in a world like ours, happiness is only possible when both material and spiritual salvation are ensured. As its name indicates, our organization brings both material and spiritual salvation to the world. On the individual level, this means the fulfillment of the individual's wishes in terms of actual benefit in this life. On the social level, it means cultural reform. In practice, though, as the revelations of God show, contemporary civilization harbors inherent fallacies, fallacies that no one has yet seemed to notice. On account of them moreover, it often happens that a course of action adopted as being helpful often actually leads to harm. In short, something designed to promote the welfare of humanity results in the promotion of unhappiness. The facts prove this better than anything else. Even though civilization has developed to its present level human beings not only fail to find happiness but tend to suffer more and more. Insofar as our civilization is the product of the wisdom and repeated efforts of great men and women, and wise scholars, who have appeared one after another over thousands of years, it should by now have reached a level of such supreme excellence that any serious inherent fallacy would be unthinkable. Yet I know that such fallacies exist. My wish is to make people understand this as quickly as possible, to share happiness with them, and to impart to them a policy for the creation of a new and ideal world civilization. This is the will of God. I would like to say here a few words about myself. Before I begin, I must explain that, though my background is that of an ordinary human being, my destiny is a mysterious one, unparalleled in human history. I have been born to help the world in a way entirely different from such great religious leaders of the past as the Buddha, Jesus Christ, and Mohammed. I have been given the power to accomplish what could not be accomplished in their time. I can, for instance, know anything that is important to know in the divine, spiritual and physical worlds and in the past, present, and future － within the limits, of course, of matters relating to helping humanity and the creation of an ideal world. It is fascinating that I can foresee, not only my own fate, but also changes that will take place in the world. Furthermore, experience to date has shown that my predictions are in general accurate. It is as if dreams were to come true. I am constantly making plans and undertaking projects that, without exception, go as I want. If I decide to write a literary work on some topic or other, the words flow forth naturally. As you know, I am fond of poetry and can produce a surprisingly large number of verses. For instance, it is easy for me to compose fifty short verses in an hour. I would like to write other verse types, novels, and plays as well but lack of time prevents me. I also write satires and humorous literature. Although I have had no experience with the genre, I was able to write the ritual prayer our members recite. As you all know, I am also constructing a large-scale prototype of Paradise on Earth and have chosen each stone, tree, and flowering plant myself. I designed the landscaping, architecture, and decor. In designing the Hall of Worship in the prototype of paradise that we are now building, I have employed the LeCorbusier style now prevalent in the architectural world. But I have done so in a new way so that, when the building is completed, it is certain to attract global attention. I have almost no need to think about the landscaping or architectural work, since if I only stand and look at the space for which some project is planned, concrete images arise before me. I have never studied these subjects; it is just that, if I decide to do something, I immediately get good ideas. I arrange flowers, paint pictures, and do calligraphy. Although I have studied painting a little, in all these other fields I am a complete amateur. I understand things that will happen a century in the future in politics, education, economics, philosophy, and medicine. Knowing as I do the fundamental ways in which contemporary civilization is in error, I am impatient to do something to introduce reforms, awaken humanity, and bring happiness to the world. But there is nothing I can do until the right time comes. At present I can only, in connection with the creation of a paradise on earth, point out problems related to health, which is fundamental to everything else, and mistakes in agriculture as they have been revealed to me. 012. Power of the Spirit The most surprising thing to me is the way I can make use of the power of the spirit to enable members to heal illness, and to know the cures they effect are lasting and sound. Christ and other sages and holy people have been able to cure illness miraculously, but almost always in only one person at a time; it was impossible for them to help hundreds of minions of people. In order to help all mankind, it is essential to endow an infinite number of other people with the power to heal. This is what I am now doing － with amazing results, as the development of our organization most strikingly shows. As I said earlier, even Christ and the Buddha were unable to do this. God has enabled me to do these things because the right time has come. When I think about God's reasons for giving me such great powers, I am deeply impressed with the importance of my own mission. Of course, God never creates anything superfluous. Everything is made or destroyed in answer to a need. If this is seen as the truth of what I say, my heaven-sent mission emerges clearly. I am constantly being informed about all mysteries and have been given limitless, profound powers of divine wisdom. I do all things on the basis of revelation in order to impart this knowledge to all people and to create an ideal civilization. Humanity has become so sophisticated intellectually that the simple explanations that worked in the past now fail to convince. Miracles proving those principles are required so that people can accept them and God manifests miracles accordingly. We should be overwhelmingly grateful that God not only points out our errors, but also works miracles to substantiate what is revealed. The divine work that I am now carrying out removes all ground for doubt about the truth of what I have just said. November 25, 1950 013. The Feudalism of Science A large segment of the populace has recently come to realize that our Johrei is much more effective than modern medical science; but I would like to say a few words here on a related and difficult problem. No matter how tremendously effective Johrei is, it naturally cannot cure all cases and unfortunately, people sometimes die. When this happens, our opponents raise a great clamor. Some, with seeming glee, seize the chance to criticize us in the newspapers. Yet at the same time most people accept death as a possible outcome of medical treatment. We all know of instances in which patients have died as a result of a single injection. People who at first felt assured of recovery through medical treatment have gradually weakened and finally died. Others have perished because of unsuccessful surgery. But few people are critical and suspicious about such deaths; admittedly, close relatives are sometimes so enraged that they sue the doctors concerned, but it is very difficult to settle matters of this kind through lawsuits, and they usually swallow their indignation and give up. In spite of the effectiveness of our method, we are often credited with no more than psychological cures, or are showered with the kind of criticism and attacks I have already described when we make a slight mistake. In short, mistaken trust in the power of medical science has the upper hand. Of course, this is no recent development there have been numerous similar instances in the past. It may be that this is the lot of a pioneer, but I should like to examine the reasons why society, in spite of its considerable advances, persists in harboring this irrational attitude. Because materialistic science is a fundamental condition of modern society, practically everything considered nonscientific is rejected as superstition. It amazes me that people refuse to realize that science is not omnipotent, no matter how advanced it is. There are many problems for which it has no answers. As I always say, people blindly put all their expectations in scientific progress because they have become the captives of what might be called the superstition of science, which probably does incalculable harm. Some of the most notable damage is caused by medical science. But in this case, unaware that their adherence to it is profoundly superstitious, people persist in believing that only medical science is effective, and in refusing to pay attention to any other kind of therapy, no matter how effective and socially useful it is. In a word, Japan today is subservient to science in a feudal way. This is not without reason; history shows that before the dawn of the scientific age in this country, various widely held superstitions did great harm and that it was science that played a considerable part in rectifying this situation. Yet at some stage the worship of science went too far and came to dominate people's minds completely. Even though they consider science supreme, people entertain doubts when they find that medicine is incapable of curing illness. Abandoning medicine, they seek psychological tranquility in one of the established religions. Then, if unable to find satisfaction in this way, they turn to the new religious teachings and come to us. Before World War II, the Japanese people considered the feudal principle of patriotism and fidelity to one's sovereign to be the highest morality, and, as we still recall advocates of democracy were promptly thrown into prison. Today, most people worship science as the supreme morality and despise and reject our teaching, just as democracy was despised and rejected in the past. March 26, 1952 014. Tomorrow's Civilization I shall now reveal the results of about twenty years of study on all aspects of the spirit and the spiritual world. Properly speaking, in so far as the spirit is intangible － in a sense, immaterial － there is no way in which its existence can be proved experimentally, so that it is obviously difficult to develop the study of it into a concrete branch of learning. However, as I have already said, I am convinced that the irresistible march of science will eventually bring it, academically and scientifically, within the grasp of the most ordinary of men. The modern science whose great blessings we all enjoy now was originally based on what seemed to be the dreamlike, far-fetched imaginings of pioneers in earlier ages. These imaginings have evolved into important fields of scholarship. When this is taken into consideration, it becomes clear that the recognition of the existence of the spirit and the creation of an important department of learning to deal with spiritual science are only a matter of time. The civilized modern person who refuses to accept the existence of the spirit and the spiritual world, no matter how carefully they are explained, is like an uncivilized savage who refuses to accept the existence of air pervading the spaces all around him. But once one admits the existence of the spirit in observing the actual world, everything becomes totally clear and free of contradiction and inconsistency. In the same way, the source of the difficulties that make me criticize materialistic science becomes easy to grasp, in that the manifestation of this wondrous power is, in itself, the truth. This will give some idea of the nature of the great change taking place in the world at present, and of the new civilization that will be born as a result. What will this civilization be like? It will inevitably be characterized by the emergence and development of a spiritual culture. And as the relation between matter and spirit becomes to some extent clearer, it should have a remarkably stimulating effect on established civilization also. This will, of course, take place after the war is over. It is not an idle dream to assume that, just as the development of material civilization revealed the true nature of air and was therefore beneficial to humanity, so more sophisticated machines will serve humankind by making it possible to measure and utilize spirit. In my study of the relation between the spirit and illness, I have finally come to know its essential character and the cause-and-effect relations connected with it and have learned that these things are intimately connected not only with human illness, but also with change and renewal in all phenomena. However, since the solution of illness is the topic of this book, I shall here confine myself mostly to the relationship between the spirit and illness. My healing art is ahead of its time in that it has reached the stage where it is possible to make spiritual science serve humankind by manifesting astonishing powers for the improvement of human health. October 23, 1943 015. The True Nature of Illness Illness is what happens when an abnormality arises in one part or the whole of the human body and suffering follows as a result; however, medical science has not yet understood precisely what causes such an abnormality. Here I should like to outline the research I have done on this topic. All animals consist essentially of the spiritual and the physical bodies, the close and inseparable connection of which gives rise to the life force. The spirit is controlled by the will, which arises from the soul. Western medical science has completely ignored the spirit and has concentrated, in minute analytical studies, on the body. This is all that can be expected as long as science remains materialistic in attitude. The true cause of illness, however, is not in the body, but in the spirit. Sickness arises first in the spirit and then transfers to the body. In other words, the spirit is the cause of illness, and physical manifestations in the body are the result. Even hundreds of years more of research will not result in cures unless the relation between spirit and body is clearly understood. At its present stage of development, science is incapable of employing instruments to measure the spirit. Its prevailing situation is identical to the state of civilization before humanity discovered the existence of air in apparently empty space. A science that discovered the component elements of air is certainly not incapable of discovering the existence of the spirit. The discovery of air led to sudden forward leaps in science. Similarly, the discovery of the existence of the spirit will bring about the establishment of a true medicine, a true therapy and, by uniting religion and science, will eradicate once and for all the contemporary conflict between the claims of science and the spirit. I am at present achieving astounding cures through a theory concentrated on the spirit. So startling are our achievements, in fact, that people describe them as miracles. However, anyone who understands the principle of spirit-oriented healing without medicines and without physical therapy realizes that what we do is perfectly natural, and not mysterious. On the contrary, we should consider it a miracle if anyone were able to heal completely by means of therapy concentrated on the body alone. I am not criticizing science, but pointing out the fallacies of medical science. Science has brought humanity immeasurable blessings, and it must continue developing in the future. But I hope that its future progress will be in union with religion. There is one point in this connection on which it is easy to err. As I have said, human beings have spirits controlled by will. Machines do not. Nonetheless, in its role as a kind of magician, science tends to make machines and instruments work as if they were alive and even to replace living human beings with them. But it is impossible to treat living human beings as machines. Because they are nothing but physical matter, damaged machines can be repaired with tools, oil, and the like, which are themselves physical matter. The human body's blood vessels, nerves, and cells are constantly changing and ceaselessly engaging in metabolic processes. It is truly a mystery. It is not produced on the basis of scientific principles. The human body is something we cannot make, no matter how hard we try. Yet we cannot stop it from being made. It is a mystic product of creation, and a human being is a higher spiritual being completely different from plants, birds, beasts, and fish. May 15, 1936 HEALTH 016. The Truth of Health In taking about health, the very first principle that must be understood is that good health depends on obeying and respecting the natural order. Therefore, we must first consider the purpose of God, the creator, in making human beings. We interpret that purpose to be the creation of an ideal world consisting of truth, virtue, and beauty. This astounding idea is not easy to accept at first; who knows how many tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, even millions of years it may take to attain the ideal? But history shows that the world has been moving, step by step, in the direction of its attainment. God is spiritual, and a human being is physical. Working together, the two are making unlimited progress. Humanity is in charge of this undertaking. Our responsibility is immense, and to accomplish it we must be in good health. Having given us various missions to carry out, God has endowed us with the degree of health we need to fulfill our responsibilities. Should we lose that health, God's purpose in creating us would miscarry. Profound reflection on this truth makes it clear that our normal state is that of good health. But, surprisingly, we fall ill － or become abnormal － easily. Once this basic truth is understood, it becomes apparent that converting the abnormal condition into the normal condition is in harmony with God's purpose. In considering this truth, reflection shows that abnormalities in the human body result from deviations from the laws of nature. Corrective therapy needs, of course, to understand the abnormality, correct it and restore the body to its normal state. Consequently, I shall now set out in detail the kind of deviations that disrupt the natural order. When first born, human infants are fed on mother's milk or formula because they still lack teeth and their digestive organs are still weak. Gradually, as they gain their teeth and as their internal organs mature, their diets are supplemented with appropriate foods. Each of the many varieties of foods available to us has a distinctive flavor, and the human body has been endowed with a sense of taste enabling it to take pleasure in those flavors. The rest of our environment is well supplied with the right amounts of air, fire, and water for the maintenance of human health. The human being is equally well equipped. The brain is endowed with the ability to reason, remember, and react emotionally. The hands can make things, and the feet and legs give freedom of movement. Other necessary parts such as hair, nails, eyes, nose, mouth and ears are provided. The skin that covers the face and the rest of the body contributes to human beauty. Outlined in such detail, the human being proves to be a wonderful work of creation. One is moved by the wonder of God's work in a single flower, a leaf, a beautiful natural view and all birds and beasts down to the last insect and fish; but humanity is certainly the Creator's masterpiece. The miracle of the reproductive process ensuring continuance of the species defies description. When we realize that the human body is the Creator's masterpiece, we see that illness, which inhibits human action, is an aberration against nature. This is the point to which human beings must devote most serious thought. April 20, 1950 017. Human Beings as Vessels for Health Since humankind was made to be healthy, we must correct the old belief that human beings are vessels filled with illnesses. Nothing could be further from the truth. A human being is a vessel for health. Nonetheless, we are subject to illness, and since the problem seems insoluble, many people give up and accept what they consider to be inevitable fate. Of course, illness is often difficult to cure. Sickness may linger for so long or recur so frequently that people may be sick more often than they are healthy. For this reason, people have come to think of their bodies as vessels for illness and have invented a proverb to express their condition. It is not surprising that, because the basic nature of illness has remained unknown, people have come to believe that sickness and death are unavoidable. The same belief led the Buddha to say that all life consists of the four sorrows of birth, illness, aging, and death. I have already explained that illness is caused by deviations from the laws of nature. When people become ill, they usually resort to medicines, which is a mistaken course of action. It is unnatural to employ either Chinese medicines, which are made of herbs, roots, and barks, or Western medicines, which are usually extracts of mineral and vegetable substances. Medicines are always bitter, malodorous, sour, or otherwise disagreeable; since olden times, people have spoken of the need to eat or drink something good to refresh the mouth after a medicinal dose. Medicines are unpleasant because God made them so in order to show that they are poisonous and should not be taken. In contrast, all wholesome foods and drinks are designed to please the palate. This is the way of nature. It is a mistake to attempt to define in generalities what is and is not nutritious. Foods differ according to the soil, climate, and locale in which they grow, but they are all produced to suit the needs of the people living on that soil and in that locale. It is right for Eastern peoples to eat rice, and Western peoples to eat wheat. People of an island nation like Japan eat large amounts of fish, and continental people eat meat. In accordance with this line of thought it is right for farmers to eat plenty of vegetables, since a vegetarian diet is suited to people who must work long hours without resting. If the nutritionists of our time have their way in convincing farmers to eat more fish and meat, agricultural labor power will decrease. Since they eat seafood, fisherman work intermittently and are incapable of long periods of sustained labor. Moreover, eating seafood increases sensitivity and in this way also suits the needs of fishermen. Nature is truly wonderful. April 20, 1950 018. True Health and False Health Almost all humankind － or at least almost all members of the "civilized" peoples － are ill. Some are not visibly sick while some are manifestly so. In other words, the people actually suffering are clearly ill, and the apparently healthy suffer from latent illness. Here I shall deal only with the condition of the latently ill, since there is no need to explain the condition of the manifestly sick. The latently ill harbor toxins, but purification to break down their solidified state has not yet started. A truly healthy person is one who is absolutely free of toxins and in whom no purification process takes place. In comparison with this, the latently ill person harbors accumulated toxins yet apparently stays in good condition, carries out his daily duties, even hard labor, and looks totally healthy. Furthermore, since it is difficult to discover such toxins, modern medical examination pronounces such people healthy. I call this condition "false health," and cannot help shuddering to think how many people today go merrily on their way in spite of the explosive load of illness they bear. The old-fashioned saying that human beings are "vessels for illness" refers to this state of "false health." February 5, 1947 019. Raising Healthy Children Japanese children today are in poor health. It alarms me greatly to see how poor their facial color is and how frail they look. In the past this condition prevailed largely among urban children, but lately it has also begun affecting those in farming villages. Physical examinations conducted at a primary school in a certain village in Nagano Prefecture, located in central Japan, showed that eighty-one out of one hundred children were suspected of suffering from tuberculosis. Since then, similar reports have appeared from time to time in the newspapers. It must puzzle everyone to read this kind of thing at a time when modern medical progress has reached even rural areas. The gravity of the problem is all the greater in that the cause of the phenomenon has not been found. To enable people to understand, I shall describe the cause in terms of my system of natural medicine. The only conceivable cause of poor health among urban and rural children is mistaken hygiene and nutrition. The mistake lies in believing that Japanese children are exactly like Western children, and in raising them totally in the Western mode. This is a grave error. Japanese and Western children are essentially different. The mistaken idea that Japanese children can be raised in the Western way seems in the past to have been limited to the city, but has now spread to the country as well. The error of the Western way is in ignoring nature, giving children too much milk, neglecting breast-feeding, pampering, overdosing with medicine, and administering the wrong kinds of injections. Though theoretically acceptable, this kind of rearing actually weakens children physically. The system may be suitable for Westerners, who have been accustomed to it for generations, but it represents a sudden and bad change for the Japanese. If there must be a change in the old-fashioned way, which the Japanese have long found compatible, it should be gradual. The facts make this perfectly clear. Children were much healthier a few decades ago at a time when medical science had not yet advanced to the level it has reached today. For the sake of reference, I shall now describe the right way to raise children. Mothers should work until the month of their delivery if possible. They should breast-feed their children, and use cow's milk only when absolutely necessary. Children should be allowed to live in as natural a way as possible, and mothers should not be too worried over things like catching cold. In other words, children should not be unnecessarily bundled up, but should be allowed to go their own ways without too much parental interference. Use of medicines must be minimized. Parents should recognize that children are born into this world endowed with the capacity for healthy growth. Too much coddling only weakens them. The best general policy is to keep in mind the venerable old ways handed down from our ancestors without being carried away by the fashions of the times. We should use modern progress by adopting not its theories, but its truly good aspects. I strongly urge authorities and specialists to take this point into consideration. March 14, 1951 020. A Way for Anyone to Put on Weight A large number of people who are born thin yet want to put on weight try all kinds of methods to no avail Practically everyone has at some time seen a woman with lovely facial features who was too thin to allow her innate good looks to show to best effect, and has thought regretfully how beautiful she would be if only she were a little plumper. Sometimes physical debility makes children peevish, and frail It is common for parents wanting to strengthen their offspring to feed them milk, cod-liver oil, and other nutritious foods and to lament later that all their efforts have produced no weight gain. There is away by which people like this can fatten up and improve their facial color. On the shoulders of people who cannot gain weight there is invariably a hard, rocklike place that is slightly feverish.* Because it exhausts cells, this fever sharply reduces the appetite; but if Johrei is used on it, the hard spot will gradually soften. As this happens, the appetite will increase, and the person will put on weight. Not only does Johrei make people healthy, it makes them beautiful too. If this method were known widely throughout the world, we would all be able to rejoice at the increased number of lovely people. Parents too would be made happy by the improved health of their children. January 10, 1951 021. The Way to be Beautiful There are three major kinds of beauty: artificial, natural, and emotional. Artificial beauty is the result of using powders and rouges, but natural beauty is the result of good health and good circulation; it is the beauty of vitality and vigor. Emotional beauty springs from the heart and inspires respect and affection in others. Today women plaster themselves with powder, rouge, and lipstick to make themselves look lovely because they have forgotten everything but artificial beauty. Yet there is a way to be lovely from one's innermost core without resorting to ridiculously costly cosmetics. This is true beauty, which comes from good health and purifying the blood. Women's skin becomes lusterless, wrinkled, pallid and puffy from the use of too many medicines. To hide these effects, women today make excessive use of cosmetics. True loveliness is impossible without inner beauty, which comes from faith. We see this in people receiving Johrei, who grow so much more beautiful as time passes that it is almost impossible to recognize them. September 3, 1949 *The person administering Johrei does not touch the afflicted person's shoulders. Instead, the person receiving Johrei ascertains the hardness or softness of his or her own shoulders. 022. Medicine and Sport Athletes, who have splendid bodies and great physical strength, are generally considered likely to die fairly young. Why this should happen is a riddle to medical science, but the following are the reasons. Although there are many kinds of sports, a person usually specializes in only one kind. Consequently the athlete repeats the same movements over and over through long hours of training, so that toxins gather and harden at his power points. As time passes, the purification process starts. But since toxins are more persistent in athletes than in ordinary people, purification and cure are more difficult for them. My own experience has shown that hard protuberances of accumulated toxins form on one shoulder or the other of swimmers, and that the purification process associated with them produces symptoms similar to those of tuberculosis. In evalulating the condition of such swimmers, doctors frequently diagnose tuberculosis, and this accounts for the large number of persons in this field apparently suffering from this disease. Similarly, golfers tend to be afflicted with kidney trouble, because tensing the waist and hip region causes toxins to accumulate and harden around the kidney area, and it is a well known fact that marathon runners frequently suffer from enlargement of the heart. For the sake of their health, athletes ought to engage in two or more sports. Musicians should also be careful, since their work calls for repetition of the same movements, which could lead to sickness. For example, people who are fond of piano playing have accumulations of toxins in their chest regions since their power points are in both arms. Violinists are subject to the same kind of problem in their shoulders, and cellists in their left shoulder and hip region. These conditions deserve serious thought, and musicians should compensate by performing movements other than the ones involved in their work. February 5, 1947 023. My Health Plan I should like to explain the method I myself follow in keeping fit. This year I am sixty-seven years old according to the Western way of reckoning age, but I am more hale and hearty than many men in the prime of life. I frequently climb the hill on whose slopes our new headquarters is being built and always have to slow down for the younger people, who lack strength in their legs. I am almost embarrassed by their frequent questions as to whether Meishu-sama is tired, since I am not fatigued in the least. I go to bed at two thirty or three in the morning and sleep till seven or seven thirty, which means I have about four or four and a half hours' sleep. As my close associates know, I do the work of ten people. Younger people find it hard to keep up with me, but there is nothing to do but let them keep trying. I do all these things as a result of my method of keeping healthy. Since my way is the opposite of the one generally followed today, I shall explain it here in the hope that it will serve as a reference for other people. The modern medical prescription for good health is to exert oneself only moderately, to get plenty of sleep and nourishment, to chew one's food well, and not to think too hard. My method is the opposite of this. I insist that people should exert themselves to the maximum* since this is a most effective way to improve health. Nonetheless, I urge sensible moderation, since overexertion can cause suffering. The amount of sleep a person requires varies with age, but for a person of about my age four or five hours is just right. Interestingly enough, as far as food is concerned, I am constantly worried about getting too much nourishment. There are so many offerings from members that we can scarcely cope with them, and I always make a point of eating at least a little of each in appreciation of their kindness, so that I tend, if anything, to eat too many rich things. To make up for this I unfailingly eat a considerable quantity of sweet potatoes after breakfast each morning. As a late-night snack, I often have a bowl of plain rice-and-tea and never miss a serving of sweet bean-soup. Foods have yang (positive) and yin (negative) characteristics that must be kept balanced. Vegetables are yin and fish and meat are yang. These foods must be taken in a way that avoids leaning too much in either direction. I eat seventy percent yin and thirty percent yang foods in the morning, fifty percent of each at lunch, and seventy percent yang and thirty percent yin foods in the evening. Pickles too are yin or yang in nature: pickled green leafy vegetables are yin and pickled daikon, radish and turnip are yang. I eat them in a half-and-half ratio. I chew my food only about halfway, not thoroughly, because chewing food fully weakens the stomach. Furthermore, I do not rest after meals but immediately begin some activity.** This is a way to strengthen the stomach. I have effectively cured stomach illnesses through this method. I never set limits to the foods I eat. My basic dietary principle is to eat as much as I want of what I want when I want it. It is, however, impossible to be always as self-indulgent as this statement suggests, so I eat suitably. Though it may sound surprising, thinking as much as possible is a kind of health regimen. People who use their brains live long, but worrying is a poor use of them. Instead, one should use them in interesting, pleasant ways. This is where faith reveals its value. Whenever you have a worry, if you take the attitude that you should leave it up to God, the worry will diminish considerably. In other words, let God shoulder the burden. Perhaps this seems conveniently selfish, but God finds such selfishness highly pleasing. For a long time, no matter how it might rain or blow, I have never missed going out once a day. I walk as much as possible. Old people who continue to improve in health often say the same thing. I drink only about three small sake-cups of sake or one small glass of beer and smoke only an average amount.*** This is my system for good health. I pay no attention at all to germs. Although the ordinary person might consider my method unwholesome, in fact it is the true way to be healthy. I guarantee that anyone who buts this method into practice will become healthy. There is no chance, at least, of your becoming a pallid indoor type, so I recommend that you put your mind at ease and follow the system I have set forth. April 20, 1950 *(Exert oneself to the maximum) This means that healthy people must not pamper their bodies. It does not mean that people who are confined because of illness or who are constitutionally frail should attempt to lead the same kind of active lives as completely healthy people. **(When I have finished eating, I immediately begin some activity) This does not pertain to the ill. ***Meishu-sama did not inhale but only enjoyed the fragrance of cigarettes. He smoked four or five a day and did not recommend that others smoke. 024. What is Death? In life, no issue is as urgent or as imponderable as death. As a result of my own long personal experience and of my researches into various religions, experiments in spiritualism conducted in the West, and every other related field, I have arrived at an answer. I shall begin my explanation by describing the composition of the human being, which is not the physical body as scientists claim but is composed of two fundamental elements: the physical body and the spirit (element of fire). The elements of water and soil are the fundamental components of the physical body, which cannot function as a living being without the soul, the intangible spiritual element. The human body is no more than the visible manifestation of the spirit, and the separation of the spirit from the body is what is meant by death. When the physical body grows old or ill, or is injured or suffers excessive loss of blood, and can no longer be used, the law is that the spirit must separate from it. The loss of the element of spirit, or of fire, causes the body temperature to drop and the blood to coagulate at certain points. The element of spirit, in the form the physical body had in life, then goes to a separate world called the spiritual realm. Because it is an excellent example of how this happens, I shall describe an experiment once conducted in the West in connection with the form of the spirit. As a certain patient was approaching death, the nurse on whom this experiment was being conducted noticed a white, steam like vapor rising from the vicinity of the ill person's forehead. It thickened and, after forming a large oval in space, gradually assumed the shape of a human body like the one the patient had had in life. The vapor form hovered in the air about three feet above the now lifeless corpse, and looking down on the grieving family surrounding the bed, seemed to want to say something, but finally quietly floated toward the window and thence outside. The spirit is thought usually to leave the body from a limited number of places: the forehead, the abdomen, or the feet. In instances like death by explosion, when the body is mangled, the spirit is temporarily dispersed into countless fine particles but immediately reassembles centripetally to assume the shape of body the victim had in life. From there, it proceeds just as do the spirits of those who die as a result of illness. When the spirit moves to any given place under its own volition, it assumes a spherical shape as it floats through space. People who can see these spirits, like the nurse in the above example, have special powers that are either innate or acquired through training. There have been many such people in our country, and I have met them on numerous occasions. One woman whom I used in an experiment proved to have wonderful powers of clairvoyance. 1939 025. Life and Death Since ancient times, people have devoted more energy to the problem of death than to any other. Nothing is more terrifying than death, which puts an end to all happiness and hopes. Yet with the exception of certain special cases, the majority of deaths are caused, one might say inevitably, by sickness. Most deaths occurring before the age of ninety result from illness － are, in other words, unnatural. The natural human life span would be terminated not by sickness, but by aging and gradually increasing physical debility. For this reason, people who die in this natural way do not suffer and usually can for see the end. The corollary is that deaths accompanied by suffering do not represent the natural termination of life. People are merely resigning themselves to their lot when, in a case of premature death, they seek comfort in words such as "His time had come." The famous Zen priest Torisu Etsuzan, who died a few years ago at the age of one hundred and twelve, foresaw his own demise. He called a considerable number of immediate family members, relatives, and friends to his side, said some parting words to each, and meditating until the prophesied time arrived, died quietly and painlessly. This is an excellent example of a "natural" death. 1939 026. Natural and Unnatural Death Death is the extinction of life that occurs when, like a tree that withers and dies, the physical being is no longer capable of living. The numerous causes of death can be grouped into two major categories: natural and unnatural. Natural death comes when the living being's allotted span of years has been exhausted. Unnatural death results from illness, accident, violence or suicide. Human beings should die naturally; yet, incredible as it may seem, natural deaths have steadily decreased in frequency as civilization has advanced, while unnatural ones, especially those caused by illness, have increased. Why is it that, in spite of inexorable advances in other fields of civilization, the situation in relation to human life has retrogressed? This single fact should make one suspect some grave error, yet despite their limitless desire for research in other fields, they remain extremely indifferent to this issue, presumably because they are resigned to their inability to do anything about the question of mortality. This is because no science or religion of the past has ever been able to provide a definite solution to the question. Consequently, no matter what progress is made in other fields, in this one area man has no recourse at present but to let nature run its course. The topic obviously requires further thought. Nothing could be more contrary to the intentions of God, who made man to be the supreme animal, than for unnatural deaths to exceed natural deaths in number － and to continue increasing. If God is indeed almighty, sooner or later He must restore to humanity its qualifications as leader of creation. There is obviously no reason for God to look on silently forever at the abnormalities of human life. It is natural, it follows, that the Almighty God should eliminate unnatural deaths and thereby lengthen human life through divine power. And this only underlines further the imminence of the world of light, the world free of sickness for which humanity has hoped for thousands of years. June 19, 1936 TOXINS 027. An Analysis of Toxins I shall now turn to an explanation of toxins. Basically, toxin is something that taints the blood, or clouds the spirit. This tainting or clouding arises, of course, as a result of contamination through evil. The idea of contamination has been made much of by religions since ancient time, but so far accounts of it have been over-simplistic: evil is contaminating, so it should be avoided. But this kind of explanation cannot possibly convince a civilization that has become intellectual and scientific. Today, people require a sound argument based on empirical logic. Just as the world consists of a physical and a spiritual realm, so a human being is made up of inseparably interrelated physical and spiritual beings. Because the spirit and body are one, cloudiness of the spirit is reflected in the blood and vice versa. This is of paramount importance, and must be clearly understood. The physical wrong a person commits causes clouds to form on the spirit. An accumulation of these clouds cause a purification process to begin; this may take the form of illness, legal punishment, or some other disaster. Any wrong which escapes these kinds of purification will be spiritually punished according to God's law. A person may avoid retribution by his fellow mm, but the punishment of God is absolute and will be reflected in the body in the form of some great suffering. Such illnesses are highly malignant and often fatal. The process of suffering the consequences of evil can be likened to a debt. The longer it goes unpaid, the more the interest accumulates. Those rare villains who manage to avoid the punishment of humankind and God in this world will plunge into hell when they die because of the gravity of their misdeeds, and finally be obliged to repent. The hell in question is like that which the Buddhists call Avichi, the lowest of all hellish regions, or the Nezoko-no-kuni (land below the roots) of Shintoism, where there is complete darkness in which one remains as if frozen for hundreds of years. All desperately wicked people must resign themselves to going to this kind of world. I realize that modern people will have difficulty accepting this, but I insist it be believed, since what I say comes directly from spirits I have heard during my researches into the spiritual realm. The self-reproach one feels at doing wrong results in suffering which is in itself a form of mild purification. It would be good if complete repentance followed at this stage, but it rarely does, and most people go on sinning more and more. The extent of one's spiritual cloudiness is commensurate with the degree of wrongdoing. Clouds, however, can come from without as well as from within. Take, for example, a case where one person causes another suffering. The victim becomes angry and bitter, and these emotions are transmitted through spiritual cords to the spiritual being of the person who caused the original harm, and thus cause clouds. By contrast, when one person makes another happy, his or her gratitude is transmitted back in the form of light to the benefactor, whose clouds are reduced by it. It is a fundamental law of nature that the more such good deeds are done in secret, and without desire for reward the greater will be the reward from God. Human beings shall believe and abide by this absolute truth. Purification of the cloudiness causes sickness and other disasters; therefore, if human beings wish to be happy they must do good, not wrong, and thereby prevent their spirits from becoming clouded. Next, I shall touch on the subject from the physical standpoint. The form of illness which comes from murkiness in the blood is, of course, caused by the poison called medicine. Medicines are essentially toxic, but people have mistakenly interpreted them as beneficial because they are unaware that sickness is a purification process. I shall explain the principle involved in toxic medicine from the standpoint of practical experiment, but must point out that even people who have been cured by Johrei can suffer a relapse. We call this repurification. Though the initial Johrei removes the toxins that have already stimulated the purification process, as the person returns to vigorous, active work, a brisk purification starts again. In other words, the patient becomes healthy as a result of purification, and further purification is stimulated by this good health. As the process is repeated, the patient gradually approaches full recovery. This repurification, however, can entail fairly violent high temperatures and severe coughing. The phlegm coughed up is old and therefore thick; it is easily recognizable by its medicinal smell. The patient loses appetite, grows weak, and in rare cases may die. The Creator has enabled the earth to produce all the food needed for the nourishment of humanity, the protagonists of the world. God has given to each food its own flavor and to human beings the sense of taste. There is thus no need to worry about nutrition. Merely to eat and enjoy the things one likes is enough for good health. The principle in operation in this case is similar to that governing the sexual appetite, which has other purposes than simply to create human beings. Thus, human beings should not put into their bodies anything other than substances specified as foods. If the food has no taste or is bitter it should not be eaten. It is through, ignorance of this, that people have always made the great mistake of assuming that unpalatable medicines are good for the body. December 1,1952 028. The Three Kinds of Toxins All illnesses are caused by the three toxins: accumulated toxin (nendoku), urinary toxin (nyodoku), and medicine toxin yakudoku). Accumulated toxin could also be called hereditary medicine toxin since it is transmitted from generation to generation and is ultimately transformed into an independent kind of toxin. Urinary toxin results from excess urine caused by malfunction of the kidneys. I have already explained what medicine toxin is, and will confine myself here to explaining the ways in which it manifests itself. It mainly produces such unpleasant conditions as fever, pain, itching, diarrhea, nausea, paralysis, and so on. The fever is more noticeable in people who take medicines in large amounts. For the same reason, it can be said that people who normally use no medicines rarely suffer from fever. Again, the pain caused by Western-style medicines is often sharp, whereas pain from Chinese-style medicines is duller. February 5, 1947 029. Urinary Toxin As has frequently been pointed out, especially hard toxins that persist in the body as the result of generations of use of medicines and that are thus not readily discharged, tend to accumulate where the nerves are most dense. Since we tense our waists, hips, and backs in the positions we assume during various activities, these toxins accumulate particularly in the region of the kidneys; this is clearly illustrated in the ailments of golf enthusiasts. Since such toxins constrict the kidneys, the extent to which they accumulate affects the organ's efficiency. For instance, if kidneys operating at maximum efficiency are capable of removing ten units of urine from the body, they may be able to remove only nine units when constricted by toxin accumulation. The other unit remains in the body to become urinary toxin. Like second-stage toxins － those reinforced by some extraneous substance, such as medicine, multiplied on the original or first stage toxin － urinary toxin accumulates in regions of dense nerve concentration. Because of its relationship to bodily movements, it tends to concentrate most in the kidney region, the abdomen, the lympatic glands of the groin, the peritoneum, the shoulders and the neck. Toxin accumulation is greater on the side that is more constricted. Whereas hereditarily transmitted medicine toxins are limited in quantity, and medicine toxins themselves limited to the amounts of medicine taken, urinary toxins are constantly produced and therefore hard to treat. This urinary toxin is one of the three toxins that together are, generally speaking, the source of all disease. 1939 030. Toxins Persisting for Half a Century At the age of eighteen, I contracted pleurisy. The treatment consisted of opening a hole in my side and draining off about two hundred grams of fluid. Germicides were used in the operation. Later the illness recurred. This time I was given medicines. The combined effects of the medicines and the disinfectants caused a hard accumulation of toxins at a place between my back and armpit that I discovered only recently. I decided to give myself Johrei to get rid of it. At first, it was very hard, but it gradually softened and began to dissolve. Each time it dissolved a little more, I had diarrhea. Though the toxin accumulation caused little pain, I was interested to note how certain the occurrence of diarrhea after Johrei was. This experience proved that toxin accumulations persist for years. I am now sixty-eight, which means that that hard lump of toxins was in my body for fifty years. If I had not known about Johrei, it would have remained with me for the rest of my life. After each bout of diarrhea accompanying the dissolving of the toxins, I felt much better, even though I had thought myself quite healthy, unaware of the toxin accumulation. After the toxins finally dissolved completely my condition improved greatly, to my great joy. I feel as though I have added twenty or thirty years to my life. An even greater benefit is that my mind works so well now that writing is easier for me than ever before. What I learned from this incident, in short, was that, in people who do not know about Johrei, medicine toxins can persist for life. Furthermore, as I have always said, the sources of diarrhea are almost always either in the head or in the back. Thus there are two types of diarrhea; the kind that occurs when the accumulations of toxins in those areas disperse and collect temporarily in the abdomen; and the kind that is caused by poisoning through food or drink. When brought on by Johka (purification) of the head, diarrhea is accompanied by large fluxes of blood. June 6, 1951 031. Medicine: a Cause of Wrongdoing Most readers will probably be surprised by the title of this article. The idea of a relation between wrongdoing and medicine is indeed startling. Yet astounding as it may seem, there is actually a very serious connection between the two. Medicine, as I often insist, is poison. When it enters the body, the blood becomes cloudy. When the blood becomes muddy, the spirit becomes cloudy, and this results in discomfort for the person who has taken the medicine. The sense of discomfort is the true villain since it makes the person afflicted by it fretful, irascible, and ultimately bellicose. A person who feels well can shrug off provocative remarks from others, but may fly into a rage at practically nothing when he or she is suffering some malaise. In other words, the feeling of the moment determines whether a person is bright and cheerful or gloomy and ill-tempered. It must be taken very seriously, moreover, since it has a close connection with his or her whole fortune in life. Emotions play an important part in human life; they can lead to the break-up of married couples, quarreling between parents and children or brothers and sisters, trouble among friends, and in some cases to loss of one's job. Obviously, emotions play a very large part in all spheres of practical, everyday life: whether, for example, an employee in some government or business office is liked and trusted by his or her superiors; whether a person is approved of by his or her colleagues, or a merchant popular among his or her customers; whether a technical expert is successful in his or her work or a student in his or her study; and so on. Emotion is a normal component in all such cases; what matters is when it gets out of hand. People who have trained themselves to a state of great self-control can deal with emotional problems successfully, but ordinary human beings often look to the stimulus of drink say, or gambling as a distraction from their sense of discomfort. Others, who are well off financially and occupy a high position in society, look for similar escape in luxurious living or sexual philandering. This all costs money, which is frequently obtained by less-than-admirable means. Human beings have been known to resort to embezzlement, fraud, graft, and － most terrible of all － murder, just to acquire quite insignificant sums. Some people claim to be able to find a woman behind every crime, but I myself think medicine is at the heart of the trouble. In brief, to find emotional relief, people today seek stronger and stronger stimulation. To serve their needs, organizations offering unwholesome amusements of all kinds are increasing and are becoming steadily more accessible through modern transportation methods. These factors, combined with the breakdown of older social restrictions such as class systems make the serious life look foolish in the eyes of many. However, troubles of this kind represent the brighter side of the picture. The darker side of medication is much more serious. Here, illness is caused in almost all cases. Moreover, people recklessly dose themselves with medicines and injections, so that illnesses increase and more and more human beings experience discomfort. The ramifications of excessive reliance on medicine are extensive. First, because medicines cause increased illness, patients must spend money on treatment and lose time from work. The expenditure and the loss of time on the job reduce their income and drain their savings. They must therefore borrow or be a burden on others. They become increasingly disgusted with life. At the same time, since medicines repress but do not fully cure, the illness drags on until they find themselves in a complete impasse, and are driven to steal the needed funds or, if they are weak-willed, commit suicide, either alone or sometimes with the whole family. Cases of this kind are reported in the newspapers every day. Tuberculosis is the illness precipitating many such tragedies. To sum up, then, crime has its origins in a human sense of malaise, which is caused in turn by medicines. This is the meaning behind the title "Medicine: a Cause of Wrongdoing." February 6, 1952 032. Causes of Accidents The many accidents occurring today on highways and in other places continue to increase alarmingly, even though we are being constantly warned about them. The question of how to deal with them is so difficult that warnings and admonitions seem to be the only way open. The true cause of the accidents seems to go unrecognized; but from our viewpoint, it has to do with the condition of modern humanity's nerves. In short, people's nerves today fail to respond sensitively and quickly. Confronted with danger, people cannot react and avert harm with the agility that is essential. This sluggishness must be rectified since, in crises, a split-second's slip can spell disaster. In this connection, I am constantly struck by the lack of agility in young people. Many of them are much more sluggish than I, and I am nearly seventy. What I look on as an ordinary way of moving and acting they consider speedy. The cause of this mental dullness is the modern tendency to resort to injections or medicines unthinkingly and at every turn. Moreover, the alcoholic beverages they drink contain preservatives or other chemicals, and the foods they eat have been grown with the aid of chemical fertilizers and insecticides. People who have eaten and drunk this kind of thing for a long time usually have large accumulations of medicine toxins in their bodies. Virtually saturated in medicines and compelled to lead lives of increasing complexity in which they must think too much, modern people understandably have massive coagulations of medicine toxins in their heads. Mild purification processes are taking place in their heads all the time, so that practically no one today is mentally lucid; almost everyone suffers from hotness, rushes of blood, heaviness, and pain in the head. This mental state accounts not only for accidents, but also for the many murders and assaults reported recently in the newspapers. July 16, 1952 033. The Creator of Humanity Who created humanity? Obviously humanity itself. God created our first ancestors, but there after human beings have created other human beings. Our bodies have the mysterious power to create priceless human spirit and flesh. This power cannot be obtained through knowledge, learning, mechanical equipment, or medicines. God has endowed each human being with this innate power. If each human being has been given the wonderful power to create a physical being, then it is scarcely surprising that he should be able to cure his or her own illnesses. Natural therapies can thus produce certain results. 1936 034. Natural Therapy Human beings are indeed the artistic masterpiece of all God's creations. Truly, as is said in the Bible, humans were created in the image of God. Consequently, it is impossible for science to understand entirely the mysterious structure that is a human being. Science has only come to a partial understanding of humanity, and no one can say how many thousands of years will be required for a full understanding or even if such an understanding is scientifically possible. We can only praise the might of the Creator of so wondrous a creature with its many amazing characteristics manifest in the movements of limbs and body; in the subtle operations of will and thought in emotional expressions of joy, anger, sorrow, and pleasure; in nerves so sensitive that they find intolerable the itching caused by a mere flea bite; in a tongue capable of conveying all kinds of intentions and of tasting the flavors of all kinds of food and drink; in faces, each one unique among the 1.8 billion people on earth. Especially mysterious is the process of reproduction whereby a human being is created. In the light of these wonders, it is scarcely surprising that, as long as human beings are not scientifically produced robots, science will be unable to solve the mystery of life. The minute a person becomes ill, the body itself sets to work to eliminate the trouble. Capable of producing its own home-made medicines, the body is both a great pharmacist and a great physician. When the body is invaded by the impurity called illness, the doctor of home medicine who has his own hospital there promptly diagnoses the cause of the trouble and immediately issued a prescription to the pharmacist, thus initiating therapy. The body produces splendid medicine and maintains splendid equipment, both of which can produce effective cures. When a toxin is absorbed by the body, the body's pharmacist immediately prescribes a laxative, which induces diarrhea to rid the body of the offending substance. Other bodily reactions, too, are remarkably ingenious. For instance, the entry of harmful bacteria into the body stimulates the great sterilizing process called fever. When poisoned in one way or another, the body forces the poisons outward to prevent them entering the internal organs. The result is that red splotches appear on the skin, and itchiness and fever eliminate the cause of the trouble. Toxins stimulate the kidneys to vigorous action in order to use liquid to excrete the poison in the urine. When a great deal of dust is inhaled, the body expels it in sputum. Therefore, most illnesses can be cured by leaving them to nature.* Nevertheless, ignorant of this, people rely on the medicines and therapeutic systems developed by scientific research, thereby greatly hindering natural therapy and extending the duration of the illness. Nevertheless, a reliance on natural therapy does not completely eliminate the need for medical practice. There is much value in such things as bacteriology, some aspects of hygiene, surgery in time of war or following traffic accidents and other emergencies, dentistry, and bonesetting. 1935 *This does not mean refusing to call on the help of medical science in case of a grave and possibly fatal illness. It merely states that, since taking advantage of the natural powers of recovery of the human body is fundamental to the maintenance of good health, natural therapy is most desirable. 035. Medicine's Blind Points and the Beneficent Powers of Nature The greatest mistake of modern medicine is ignoring completely the natural powers with which human beings are innately endowed. We often hear of people who, when taken sick, go immediately to the doctor. After examining them, the doctor says, "It's a good thing you came to me without delay. If you had waited longer, it would have been too late." Doctors say such things because they believe illness or allowing an illness to go unattended, means that the patient's condition is certain to worsen. Medicine dislikes the idea of not dealing with a situation in time, and immediately prescribes medicines or other therapy to halt the sickness as soon as possible. However, it is important to realize that this eagerness to stop the progress of a sickness is a serious mistake. Sickness is the process where by toxins are eliminated. If it is allowed to run its course, the disease is certain to be cured once the toxins have been removed. It is to rid the body of toxins that such sufferings as fever, coughing, phlegm, runny nose, sweating, diarrhea, pain, and itching exist. All that is necessary is to put up with the condition for a while. When the impurities have been eliminated, the interior of the body will be clean. There is no sense in trying to deal with sickness in accordance with a timetable. Doctors, however, ignorant of this principle, take the opposite stand and strongly caution against allowing an illness to run its course. They try to block the passage of impurities the body is trying to push out, and in this way cause the toxins to harden. Obviously, this is no way to bring about a fundamental cure. Another serious blind spot of medicine is the dread of the suppuration that usually occurs when the human body suffers a wound or burn. Because of this fear, doctors make the great mistake of taking various steps to prevent infection. The shock of a wound or a burn causes toxins to collect in the injured area; everyone has a considerable amount of toxins, which the body tries to expel whenever an opportunity presents itself. Since they collect around wounds, the larger the infected area the greater the amount of toxins that will be removed from the body. This, of course, is a very good thing. The process whereby the human body is constantly cleansing itself and eliminating impurities is called natural self-therapy. Each human being is endowed with such power, and to respect it and give it every opportunity to manifest itself is the only true way to true medical science. In practice, however, as is amply borne out by the facts, doctors accept and even encourage things that hinder the operation of this natural power. Simply to realize humanity's heaven-bestowed, natural self-healing powers － more wonderful than anything medical science is capable of － is a source of immense happiness. Johrei further reinforces and stimulates these natural powers and is therefore the most progressive and rational of all therapeutic systems. July 25, 1951 036. What Is Sickness? All human beings have both innate toxins, inherited from their parents, and acquired medicine toxins, which enter the body after birth. Most people find this statement surprising. From ancient times the belief was accepted, and served as the central idea underlying medical practice, that medicine was something that cured disease and improved health, and that, given the right medicine, the problem of sickness could be solved. People have thus assumed that the discovery of good medicines would solve the problem of sickness. Everyone knows the importance the people of the United States attach to medicines, and the extreme efforts they devote to discovering new ones. If medicines produced cures, the number of illnesses should in theory gradually decrease. Instead, in apparent defiance of all reason, they are steadily on the increase. There is no such thing on earth as a truly curative medicine. All medicines are poisons, each with its own effect. The operation of the poison called medicine appears to cure because it decreases pathological symptoms. Why do I say that medicines are poisons? When the Creator made human beings he simultaneously provided all the foods they require. The things that are fit for human consumption are clearly distinguished from those that are not. Things that we should eat have pleasing flavors, and we have been endowed with a sense of taste. The scrupulous care the Creator has taken with these arrangements is revealed in the way people can derive all the nourishment they need simply by eating the things they like. We do not eat consciously to live, but live because we eat. The mystery of procreation is similar, in that men and women do not only engage in sexual intercourse specifically to have children. Children are granted to human beings as the incidental result of acts performed for other purposes. The interior functions of the human body are incapable of dealing with foreign materials other than the ones created to serve as foods. These other materials are the medicine toxins, which tend to accumulate and, as time passes, harden in various parts of the body. The resultant hard areas are found only in regions where the nerves operate, such as the upper body, especially the neck and above. This is the region dominated by the brain, and includes the eyes, ears, nose, and mouth. These are the places where toxins tend to accumulate, hardening in the vicinity of the neck and causing the stiffness in the neck and shoulder region that everyone experiences. When a certain degree of intensity has been reached, the natural elimination, or purification, process sets in. Fever dissolves the toxins, which, in fluid form, are passed out of the body in coughing, sputum, nasal discharges, sweat, bowel movements, and urine or the symptoms of what is called the common cold. The cold is a process for ridding the body of toxins. If the patient endures the discomfort and allows things to run their natural course, eventually the interior of the body will be cleansed, and a cure will be effected. This is a marvelous thing. The simple physiological process known as the cold is actually evidence of God's providence for which we ought to be grateful, even though people incorrectly interpret the suffering caused by purification. It is surely evident how mistaken medicine is in devising ways of putting an end to the process. The more vigorous and lively the human being, the more readily the purification process occurs. Attempting to halt the process can only reduce the vigor of the body. Nevertheless, people still resort to the poison called medicine. From ancient times, people have prepared liquid medicines, pills, unguents and injections by brewing, powdering, and extracting elements found in grasses, roots, barks, minerals and animal organs for use in halting the purification process. Since such poisons are strong enough to be fatal, they are administered in small, diluted doses. Amounts are laid down to be taken several times daily. A medicine that works well is one in which the toxin has been strengthened as much as possible without reaching a level that can cause addiction. The use of medicine toxins hardens those other toxins that, having been dissolved, are in solution and in the process of being eliminated. The current fuss about preventative hygiene and fear of the common cold indicate how poisoned modern man has become and how easy it is for him to fall sick. Furthermore, the happiness people feel over a life-expectation of sixty-odd years is gravely mistaken. If it were not for sickness, human beings could easily live to over a hundred. Death at less than that age is unnatural and caused by sickness., if illness were eliminated and natural death prevailed, we would all live longer. As the discussion so far should have shown, medical therapy does not cure illness but simply alleviates pain temporarily. All the methods it employs to achieve that end － total rest, wet dressings, applications, ice packs, electrical therapy, radiation treatments, and so on － only harden the toxins. Moxa cautery and heat treatments are exceptions. These use heat stimulation to guide the toxins to certain locations and bring relief from pain, but that is all; when the situation returns to what it was before, nothing lasting has been achieved. Therapy methods used until now have hardened toxins. The only way to bring about a true cure is to dissolve toxins and remove them from the body. January 1, 1953 037. The True Cause of Illness As I said in the preceding section, human beings possess various toxins when they are born into this world. Since it is impossible to maintain perfectly good health because of the obstructions these toxins create, the body is constituted to undergo a constant natural purification process to eliminate them physiologically. This natural purification process is accompanied by some pain connected with the process known as sickness. This can be illustrated by reference to the most common of all sicknesses, the cold. Though there is probably no one who has not experienced a cold at one time or another, the causes of the sickness remain unknown to medical science. My own discovery, however, has been that the cold is one of the simplest of all purification processes. A person who catches a cold is likely to manifest a variety of unpleasant symptoms － fever, headaches, coughing, expectoration, nasal discharges, loss of appetite, sweating, lethargy, and pain in the joints － that I will shortly discuss in detail. First, though, I must look at the nature of the purification process, which I divide into two categories. In the first category, various toxins in the blood accumulate and harden in various parts of the body. The places where they naturally accumulate are areas of nerve concentrations or regions that are on the underside of the body when it is at rest. As time passes, the accumulated toxins harden to produce what is commonly called stiffness. Usually this condition is painless or associated with nothing worse than stiffness of the shoulders. The second purification process occurs when the first one has already exceeded certain limits and natural elimination of toxins begins. To facilitate such elimination, it is essential to dissolve the hardened toxins. Fever is the means employed to achieve this end. The degree of fever required depends on the hardness, nature, and quantity of the toxins and on the patient's physical constitution. Fever is occasionally experienced from fatigue after exercise. This happens because exercise stimulates the purification process. The toxins dissolved by it are removed from the body in sweat expectoration, and nasal discharges. Since it results in expectoration, coughing in such cases can serve as a "pump". Nasal discharges are removed in sneezing. Sputum is expectorated after coughing; sneezing is always followed by discharge of nasal matter. Fever, expectoration, and the taking of medicine cause loss of appetite. The movement caused by the dissolution of hardened toxins and preparation to eliminate them stimulates the nerves in the affected area and brings on headache and pains in the joints. Toxins being eliminated by coughing come into contact with the mucous membranes, causing catarrh in the throat and vocal cords, which in turn cause pain and hoarseness. If no treatment is given and no medicines are used, these symptoms of the cold are left to run their natural courses and they will be cured in a short time, as the purification process is completed in an orderly way. Relying on natural therapy in this way reduces the amount of toxins in the body and improves health. By showing that colds should really be welcomed as the simplest of the purification processes, this discussion should make clear how mistaken people are when they fear them, and how mistaken medical science is to try so hard to prevent people from catching them. Since ancient times it has been said, for example, that "the cold is the source of all illness." In fact, however, it is necessary to affirm that the cold is the sole means by which all other illnesses can be avoided. Ignorant of the causes of the cold, medical science applies various methods when a person catches cold, yet all of them halt the purification process. Antipyretics, ice packs and wet applications to lower fever are examples. They have the effect of setting purification back from the second to the first category. They reharden those toxins that had begun to dissolve. Though doctor and patient are deluded into thinking the condition is improving because such symptoms as fever, coughing, and nasal discharge are reduced, actually the toxins have hardened again and the situation has regressed to what it was before second-category purification started. Recurrence of the illness is therefore only to be expected. It is important to notice that all such steps as medication, ice packs, and wet applications make the situation worse when it does recur because they halt the purification process. Consequently, the repeated interruption of minor purification processes by such means as medicines causes the toxins to accumulate and increase, thus making necessary an inevitable major purification process, which takes the form of a serious illness. February 5, 1947 038. What Is Sickness? The Cold Medical science agrees that people have various innate toxins. The body initiates a natural physiological process in the attempt to get rid of them. We call this process purification. Initially, the toxins accumulate in various parts of the body, especially in those areas where nerves are most used: the upper part of the human body, notably around the brain. When a person is awake, the brain, eyes, ears, nose, and mouth are constantly active, even though the legs and arms may be at rest. Consequently toxins accumulate mostly in the area of the brain and then in the shoulders, neck, lymph glands, the top of the spinal column, and the region of the glands under the ears. Gradually these localized accumulations of toxins harden. When the hardening reaches a certain stage, the elimination process begins. This should be regarded as a blessing. Hardening of toxins reduces vigor to the point where the human being is incapable of carrying out his fundamental tasks, by interfering with blood circulation and causing stiffness in the neck and shoulders, headaches, heaviness of the head, reduction of vision, hardness of hearing, stuffy nose, dulling of the olfactory sense, pyorrhea, bad teeth, shortness of breath, sluggishness in the legs and arms, backaches, and swelling. To prevent this, the Lord Creator provided the splendid purification process called sickness. If the pain involved in the elimination of toxins is what we call sickness and this sickness purifies the blood, it ought to be considered the greatest of all God's blessings, since it is the essential element for good health. It could even be that, if they were not subject to illness, human beings would gradually weaken and perhaps become extinct. Since I advocate the creation of a world free of illness, I might seem to contradict myself by saying this, but that is not the case. What I mean is the elimination of all toxins so that the purification process, and therefore illness, become unnecessary. I shall now explain my meaning as thoroughly as possible and in the most readily understandable way. We call the process of eliminating hardened toxins purification. When a person catches cold, the first symptom is fever. Nature employs fever to dissolve the hardened toxins and facilitate their elimination. The liquid toxins then quickly enter the lungs. This is a highly mystical process. For instance, if we dissolve the toxins by means of Johrei, they go immediately to the lungs, passing straight through muscles and bones. The condition is fairly light when toxins are concentrated in only one or two places in the body, but grows more serious as the number of concentrations increases. This is why a cold that seems mild at first sometimes grows more serious. If the liquified toxins are thin, they quickly enter the lungs then are immediately expelled from the body as sputum. If they are denser, however, the pumplike operation of coughing is called on to eliminate them through the trachea. Thus coughing is immediately followed by discharge of sputum, as sneezing is always accompanied by nasal discharge. Similarly, headaches, pain in the throat, inflammation of the inner ear and of the lymph glands, and pain in the arms and legs and the glands near the groin are all caused when toxins that were solidified in those parts liquefy and begin to move in search of an outlet. These conditions occur because of stimulation to the nerves. The fluid toxins may be either concentrated or dilute. Concentrated ones are eliminated from the body in sputum, nasal discharge, or diarrhea; extremely diluted ones are watery and may be eliminated as night sweating or urine. The completely natural way in which this purification process takes place makes one marvel at the powers of the Creator. There is no reason why God should have produced human beings and then imposed on them such a thing as illness that causes them to suffer and impedes their activity. In fact, human beings produce toxins through error and allow them to accumulate in what ought to be unfailingly healthy bodies, so that the elimination process becomes unavoidable and essential. If this is the nature of illness, it means that the ordinary cold, if left to run its course naturally, should be cured without specific treatment since the purification process will take place naturally. When this happens, the health will improve. Yet for some unaccountable reason, at some point this purification process became completely misunderstood. When an illness develops, people take extreme measures to halt purification because they interpret the accompanying pain as an indication that their condition is deteriorating. Out of fear they try to reduce the fever. Reduction of the fever halts the liquefaction of the toxins; as a consequence, all such symptoms as coughing and discharge of sputum decrease, giving the impression of recovery from the sickness. By resorting to medical therapy to treat a cold, people only reharden toxins that had started to liquefy. Since measures such as ice pack, cold applications, medicines, and injections harden toxins and simultaneously eliminate pathological symptoms, people tend to believe they are effecting a cure. In fact these measures only hinder the cleanup operation that had once begun. Colds grow worse because, by trying to halt them, people force the purification process to conflict with the nonpurification process in a way that generates friction. Even when application of medical therapy seems to have conquered it the cold will inevitably reappear. In short instead of curing illness, medicine only postpones it. The way to cure sickness is to purify the body by completely ridding it of the toxins that are the fundamental cause of illness. The only true therapy is one that when purification begins, accelerates the liquefaction of toxins and maximizes their elimination from the body. August 15, 1951 039. What Is the Common Cold? It is probably impossible for the ordinary person living as a member of society to avoid catching cold. Becoming chilled is generally regarded as the cause of colds, and it is difficult to avoid the condition that presents itself many times everyday when one may get chilled: undressing before going to bed, dressing upon waking, bathing, and going out into the cold wind and rain. Consequently, I teach that people should not worry about this too much. Sometimes, feeling cold is followed by actually catching a cold and sometimes it is not. When it is, it is because the person had a slight fever; when it is not, it is because there was no fever. In other words, the person had already caught cold, and the slight fever was the first sign of the illness; the cold would have come no matter whether his body was chilled or not. Particularly if he has a slight fever, he will shiver from cold no matter where he is and no matter how heavily he is dressed. It is important to realize, however, that when the weather changes or when a person is exposed to cold, there is no way to prevent the natural process of purification that takes place in response to those conditions. It is therefore futile to try to avoid catching colds, which are inevitable. Indeed, the attempt can have adverse psychological effects. I am convinced there is no one who can avoid a cold by being careful. Medical science still cannot pinpoint the cause of the common cold. Nevertheless, I will attempt a rough explanation in the light of my own views. First of all, the basic cause of health or sickness in human beings is the purity or impurity of their blood. A healthy person has pure blood, whereas the blood of an unhealthy person is clouded. Fortunately, a purification process is constantly taking place in the body of a person with clouded blood, and the elements (toxins) responsible for the clouding collect in one place and harden. This is, as I have already explained, the first purification process. The second purification process － that is, elimination of the hardened toxins － follows. This process is what is called the common cold. Fever dissolves and liquefies the hardened toxins, which, after first accumulating in the lungs as sputum, are expelled by the pumping action involved in coughing. In other words, the common cold is the simplest form of purification. As a result cloudy blood becomes pure, and health is improved. Consequently, the cold is a great blessing bestowed on humanity by God and a natural physiological process. November 23, 1943 040. Internal Bathing I am constantly writing about the fallacies inherent in modern medicine. Some people accept the principles on which our philosophy is based, but in reality most are unable to put it boldly into practice because they think of sickness in terms of the doctor and medicines. For the sake of that majority, I shall here explain our approach in the most readily understandable way. Probably the most easily understood sickness is the ordinary cold. When people catch cold and such symptoms as fever, coughing, phlegm, sneezing, watery nasal discharges, headaches, and pain in the joints develop, they immediately go to a doctor for a diagnosis. This is the cause of the trouble. While realizing that the sickness is no more than a cold, most people who catch one at once entertain the fear that, if they are not careful, the situation will become more serious and that they are experiencing the first stages of a much graver sickness. Some people simply do as their doctor instructs and wait to get better. Others turn to home remedies like aspirin, root and herbal brews, a drink of sake and eggs, charred orange peel, and so on, or go to bed, pile quilts on themselves, and try to sweat it out, turning bright red in the process. Not satisfied with makeshift home cures and afraid that the sickness will get out of hand and become perhaps incurable, people with less courage than money rush to their trusted physician. They ask a lot of questions, but, because the doctor himself does not understand the cause of the common cold, he or she is unable to give any clear explanation. Consequently the patient's mind is, quite naturally, not put at rest. The doctor may well suspect the danger of pneumonia, but must be content with such perfunctory injunctions as "Go to bed and rest," or "Take good care of yourself," thus only increasing the patient's anxiety. Such patients are obliged to stay at home all day with a thermometer and, from our viewpoint, look ridiculous. There is nothing more beneficial to health than the cold, since it cleans out the toxins stored in all parts of the body. It is good to sweat as much as possible and to rid of body of phlegm and nasal discharges, since these fluids contain toxins that have been dissolved by fever. The more quickly they are removed from the body, the sooner will a cure of the cold be achieved, leaving the patient feeling refreshed and in better health than before. A cold cleanses the body's interior free of charge, what could be a greater blessing than that? Just as bathing is a way to keep the outside of the body clean, a cold is a way to keep the inside clean. Washing removes the grime clinging to the skin; a cold removes the grime on the body's interior. Sputum, nasal discharges, and sweat are the interior dirt being removed from the body. Though it is easy to wash the outside of the body, similar cleansing of the interior is impossible. Nature, bearing witness to the great skill of God the creator, has provided colds to do this work, and we should be correspondingly grateful to them. Employing the toxins called medicines and misinterpreting the nature of colds, doctors do all they can to stop them. I doubt if there is one true medicine among the medicinal products of the world. All the substances now considered beneficial medicines are actually toxins retarding the natural process of recovery. Nothing is more mistaken than to rely on these toxins. People make the mistake because they are deluded into thinking that, when medicines bring relief from pain by temporarily halting the internal cleansing process, an actual cure has been effected. In short, medicine is truly a forbidden fruit. The fact that I have discovered this remarkable human error and teach Johrei, moreover, as a way of eliminating medicine toxins, clearly shows how great a salvation my work represents. It should be obvious too, that my insistence on the creation of a heaven on earth free of illness, poverty, and conflict is more than mere boasting. March 12, 1952 041. The True Cause of Sickness Is In the Soul Everything in the physical world is made up of a spiritual being and a material being. The material being decays and decomposes when the spirit leaves it This happens even in the case of stones; for example, stones that crumble and break easily are sometimes referred to as "dead." Rust on the surface of metal can be called a corpse since it represents what the metal becomes when its spiritual being departs. Well-burnished sword blades and ancient metal mirrors do not rust much because the spirit of the persons who made them have been added to those of the physical objects. All material things have spirits, but living creatures have spiritual beings. In living human beings, the spiritual being and physical body are intimately, inseparably, linked to each other. Death occurs when the spiritual being leaves the physical body for the spiritual world. Besides their spiritual beings － or rather, within their spiritual beings － all living creatures have minds and souls. The mind is the center of the spiritual being, and the soul is the center of the mind. In size, the mind is one-hundredth that of the spiritual being, and the soul is one-hundredth that of the mind. When the soul moves, the mind is put into action. When the mind moves, the spiritual being is put into action, and this in turn causes the physical being to act. The soul is the fundamental source of all human movement and of au other physical phenomena. Classified in terms of good and bad, the mind acts as good in relation to the bad of the physical being, and the soul as good in relation to the bad of the mind. The friction between the various goods and bads gives rise to a harmony which manifests itself as potential action. Consequently, illness is generated by part of the soul, which activates the physical body. Though small, the soul has free powers of expansion and contraction. When a person is awake and working, the soul assumes human form, but it becomes round during sleep. At the instant of death, the soul, the mind, and the spiritual being become round. Light is associated with this roundness. Therefore, on leaving the body, the spiritual entity assumes the form of the flying, flaming spheres which are occasionally visible to the human eye. The occurrence of illness in one particular part of the soul in its human form signifies, in fact, a clouding － diminution of the light － of a part of the soul itself. This is transmitted first to the mind, and then to the spiritual being. Finally, it manifests itself as illness in the physical being. Therefore, as long as the soul remains unclouded, the person will contract absolutely no illness. Pollution with sin is the cause of clouds on the soul. To explain this, it is necessary to delve into the field of religion. Therefore, I shall not deal with it here, but instead will explain illness as a physical manifestation. As I have already explained, when clouds occur in part of the spiritual being － let us say the lungs － the blood in the corresponding physical being becomes muddy. Since this principle is not limited to lung disease but applies to all other sicknesses, treatment must depend on removing the clouds from the spiritual being. Acquainted only with the evidence and ignorant of the main cause － that is, of this principle － modern medical science concentrates most of its research and effort on pathological symptoms in the physical being. Though it may bring temporary respite, such treatment cannot effect fundamental cures. In contrast, Johrei employs the divine light to eliminate clouds in the spiritual being. When this happens, the concentrated liquid is dissolved and the illness is either alleviated or cured entirely because purification of the spiritual being results in a cure in the physical being. However, it cannot be said that this is truly fundamental. Though certainly more fundamental than the effects of medical science, it cannot be called absolute since, unless the soul is totally purified, it is impossible to be truly mentally tranquil. Purification of the soul is only thorough when the person has a firm understanding of the right faith and puts that faith into practical action. Since this kind of action is the work of the divine light, the people carrying it out generate absolutely no sin but instead accumulate virtue. Consequently, such people lead lives of joy and rapture utterly free of illness or calamity. They enjoy happiness, long life, and prosperity. I should like to take the opportunity this discussion offers to say one more thing about the soul. Some people are easily startled by external things, and are constantly unsettled and restless because their souls have been weakened and their powers of resistance against impulses from the outside world have been reduced. The many people today who suffer from nervous debility are of this kind. The cause of the weakness is clouds in the soul, but it can be cured if the coagulation of toxic blood at the nape of the neck is dissolved. If their condition deteriorates, such people may suffer insomnia. They must also live with the likelihood of a recurrence even after a cure has been effected. Therefore they should accept Johrei and allow their souls to be so illuminated by the divine light that no clouds can develop there. 1935 042. Wrongdoing and the Fundamental Cause of Illness Illness is basically caused by pollution of the blood, and an accumulation and coagulation of suppurative fluid. These in turn are manifestations of clouds in the spiritual being. This is a result of pollution through sin, which can be either hereditary or acquired. Hereditary pollution is the accumulation and consolidation of the wrongs perpetrated by many ancestors. Acquired pollution is the accumulation of the wrongs a person commits in this life. First I shall deal in detail with hereditary pollution. We are not creatures who have suddenly sprung to life unrelated to all other beings. Each of us has thousands of ancestors and is the present living, breathing culmination of all our forebears. At the same time, however, each of us is an interim being, a temporal individuality, in an eternal process. In the large view, we are links in the chain connecting our ancestors and our descendants. In the smaller view, each of us is the link joining parent and child. To explain thoroughly how sickness can result from the wrongdoing of ancestors, it is essential to discuss life after death, that is the organization of the spiritual world. In what follows, therefore, I give a summary of the situation here. In leaving this world and passing through the gate of death, a human being divests itself of its clothing of flesh. The flesh belongs to this world, and the spirit to the spiritual world. As a result of aging or illness the physical body degenerates to the point where it is no longer serviceable, whereupon the spirit abandons this useless physical burden and goes to the spiritual world, where it must prepare for rebirth into this world. This preparation is purification. Since most people are greatly polluted by sin during physical life, in the spiritual world, as a result of a fair and strict judgment, the majority fall into hell. Enduring their punishment there, they improve little by little. Nonetheless, this purification still leaves spiritual pollutants, or a residue of sin, to be passed on in an unbroken stream to their descendants. Children and grand children must bear the burden of their forefathers' wrongs in what might be called a cause-and-effect law of atonement. Since this is the inscrutable law of God the Creator of all things, human beings have no choice but to obey it. The spiritual pollutants ceaselessly flow in the direction of a human being's brain and spinal column and, immediately after entering the soul, assume physical form as suppurative fluid, which is the cause of all kinds of illness. The second, or acquired pollution is something everyone understands well since no person is capable of living this life without doing wrong in some way or another. Of course, wrongdoing is of many kinds and degrees; there is legal wrongdoing, moral wrongdoing, social wrongdoing, and so on. Some wrongs manifest themselves in actual physical action, whereas other kinds are only wrongdoing of the mind. Though it may sound too severe, Christ's statement that a man who lusts after a woman in his heart has already committed adultery with her is certainly not mistaken. All the small acts and thoughts of daily life － hating someone, wishing another person harm, lustful desire － though apparently insignificant in themselves can become serious if allowed to accumulate over a long period. Superiority of the kind gained by victory in a competition or social success can cause the person who has not succeeded to resent or feel envious of the more fortunate person. This kind of resentment can be the cause of sin. Unnecessary taking of life, being lazy, attacking others, wasting material possessions, oversleeping in the morning, breaking promises, falsehood, and many other actions and attitudes are all sins committed without being felt as such. Though small individually, yet over a long period of time these sins can become numerous and accumulate as clouds in the soul. Contrary to what might seem to be the case, even newly born infants have acquired clouds. The case may be different after children leave their parents' sides to become independent, but as long as they are under their protection, children must share the sins of their fathers and mothers. The parents are the trunk of the tree. The boughs are the children, and smaller branches are the grandchildren. Just as no branch is unaffected by the trunk, so it is impossible that the spiritual clouds of the parents should fail to influence the offspring. Acquired pollution and its effects are often readily apparent, as the following few examples show. In two of these instances, people who persistently pulled the wool over other peoples' eyes went blind themselves. As a child I often went to Senzoku-cho, in Asakusa, to visit an old man, who in his younger years, had been the proprietor of a shop specializing in mounting scroll paintings and calligraphy and who had himself amassed a fortune as a result of his genius for forging such works of art. His new scrolls passed muster for sale as valuable antiques. However, as he told me himself, after he had grown old he went incurably blind; he died not long afterward. In another instance, the head priest of a temple in the Shizuoka district wanted to place the main Buddhist image of his temple on view in Tokyo. He took the statue to Tokyo to raise funds but failed and found himself without sufficient money for the trip home. To raise the fare, he left the statue as collateral with the proprietor of a dealer in furnishings called Hanagame, in Hanakawado, Asakusa, from whom he borrowed what he needed. Realizing its great value, Hanagame sold the image. When the priest, who had gathered the money for repayment, returned to Tokyo to redeem it, Hanagame stubbornly and brazenly refused to admit he had ever accepted it in the first place. In an irresolvable impasse, the priest hanged himself under the Hanagame eaves. Having made a huge profit on the sale of the statue, Hanagame expanded his business and for a while steadily prospered until he was extremely wealthy. But in his late years he, too, went blind. To make matters worse, his son, who was supposed to succeed his business, took to drinking and womanizing and squandered the family fortune. I often saw Hanagame as a wretched, miserable, scrawny old man being led by the hand about town by his old wife. My father told me the story of his fate. There can be no doubt that the revenge of the dead priest was at work in what happened to him. In another instance, the sin of the father was visited on the child. A girl of seventeen or eighteen who worked as a maid in our house had lost the sight of an eye when the children of the family by whom she had previously been employed accidentally shot her in the face with an air gun. It was discovered that in the middle of the nineteenth century, her father had been especially skillful at making imitation coral beads of rubber, which he sold to rural people at high prices as the genuine article. Though he made a great deal of money this way, the resentment of the people he duped must have been equally great. The father's sin was visited on the daughter in the form of lost sight in one eye. Moreover, if her eyes had been normal, this girl would have gone far in the world since, aside from this one deformity, she was very lovely. In still another instance, an old man came asking me to treat a pain in his wrist. I was so surprised that more than ten days of therapy failed to cure him that I asked what his religious faith was. He told me that for more than twenty years he had put his faith in a certain deity. As soon as he followed my advice to stop worshiping that god his arm gradually got better. And, in a week, he was completely cured. I frequently hear of people whose hands are paralyzed or painful or whose knees will not bend because they mistakenly worship the wrong deity. As these examples show, we must not underestimate acquired pollution by sin. People who suffer from illness or other hardship should carefully examine themselves to discover what they are guilty of, then repent and make amends. 1936 043. Sin and Sickness Before discussing this topic, I should say that, though "sin" tends to be thought of in religious terms, when I speak of it, I am talking about its ethical aspects. Men of religion do in fact frequently use the term sin; but, as what follows shows, sin is not some hypothetical, man-made abstraction, but a practical reality. As I said in the preceding article, when people think evil and commit evil, cloudiness in the spiritual being increases both in quantity and concentration. When the concentration reaches a certain degree, the purification process sets in naturally. This is a strict inescapable law of the spiritual world, and no one is immune to it. Though the purification process usually manifests itself as illness, it sometimes takes other forms. Where medical therapy has no effect on illness even though applied with utmost thoroughness, it is because it attempts to use mechanical and pharmaceutical means to solve a spiritual problem. It is pursuing a totally mistaken course. Praying to a god or Buddha in cases of illness, as some people do, is effective to some extent since, obviously, such beings are of the spiritual realm and their blessings help to diminish spiritual clouds. However, not even a god or Buddha － the more conscientious he is the more so, since he must be fair － will allow impurities accumulated over a long period to be resolved with only light suffering. This is like a person who has violated a national law, no matter how he repents and laments, his crime cannot be overlooked, though his punishment may be lightened as a result of his penitent attitude. In some cases, alternative kinds of purification processes have taken place before the usual one begins. In these instances, the degree of clouding is relatively light, so that only a mild purification process is required. Such prior purification may have been motivated by a psychological awakening brought about by contact with religious stories or holy writings or by the testimonials of older persons or people of distinction. The good effects these can have show the importance of good books, lectures, motion pictures, and dramas in awakening the human soul or conscience. Next, then, I should like to discuss the process occurring in the spiritual being when people are awakened in these ways. The spiritual being is in three stages; including the mind, which is the center of the spiritual being, and the soul, which is the center of the mind. The soul, which is essentially conscience, is constantly being clouded over by influences from without. It is fundamentally a radiant sphere; cloudiness in the mind, its outer casing, obscures its brilliance and puts it to sleep; but when the mind is as calm as stillwater or a clear mirror, the celestial brilliance of the soul shines forth. When a person is spiritually awakened, the soul that has slumbered suddenly shines bright. Until today, the primary ways to bring about such an awakening have been educational － for example the stories and written material that I mentioned earlier. Contact with them awakened the soul and allowed it to glow. This in turn dispelled the cloudiness of the mind and initiated purification of the spiritual being. In this way, the three elements － soul, mind, and spirit － preserve a state of balance between light and dark. In this educational approach, first the soul is awakened; then the mind and spiritual being are purified. In our therapeutic method, however, the order is the opposite: by means of Johrei from without, the spiritual being is first purified; this dispels the cloudiness of the mind and, irresistibly, awakens the soul. Furthermore, when the soul and mind are awakened by the educational method, the person undergoes the suffering of self-denial, which in turn affects the spiritual body, leading to sickness and other sufferings, whereas our therapeutic method constitutes a kind of ideal remodeling of spirit and body together, whereby the soul is awakened without its realizing it, in the course of the cure. October 23, 1943 044. Sickness and Suffering Suffering is the awareness people have that they have fallen ill. It might even seem that sickness and suffering are synonymous, but there are many different kinds of suffering. Until the present medical science has regarded suffering and illness as the same thing and has believed that easing suffering was tantamount to relieving sickness. This approach is fundamentally mistaken, as the example of the common cold will show. When people catch cold, they first develop a fever. Since the head hurts, they apply ice packs to it. Because this brings a little comfort, they feel that the lessening of the suffering is the same thing as lessening the gravity of the sickness itself. This is wrong. Illness and suffering are different the more the suffering is relieved, the more aggravated the sickness becomes. Though modern people might find this an astonishing statement, it is an unshakable truth. No medicine that fails to accept it as a fundamental tenet can be a true medicine. The explanation that follows should leave everyone who reads it totally convinced. In the past, people used to say that there was no man untainted by conceit and syphilis. Actually, there is no one who has not inherited toxins. Furthermore, most people have more of those toxins than they think. When the toxins are transformed medicines, we call them medicine toxins; I will discuss them later. As a result of the metabolic processes, toxins accumulate in various parts of the body and harden gradually with the passing of time. Toxin accumulation occurs in places where the nerves are used, and is therefore most frequent in the upper body, especially above the neck. During waking hours, the head, eyes, nose, mouth, ears, and throat work unceasingly. This is especially true of the brain, where more nerves are employed than in any other part of the body. Consequently, the toxins of the whole body are constantly moving toward the brain and accumulate to a great extent in the vicinity of the neck this is because the nerves of the eyes, nose, mouth, and ears have their origins in the brain. The phenomenon explains why most people have lumps in the neck area or stiffness in the shoulders. When toxins accumulate to the maximum degree, they impede the continued maintenance of good health. At this stage an elimination process, called purification, begins. The Creator has exercised the utmost ingenuity in providing this purification process. First a fever develops and melts the toxin lumps. Then, instantaneously, the toxins pass in fluid form into the lungs, where they are immediately expelled from the body in the process called expectoration. Coughing is the pumplike process resulting in expectoration. Toxins in the rear of the head and the vicinity of the top of the spinal column become nasal fluids, which are discharged through the nose in the process called sneezing. The way these processes act to remove liquefied toxins from the body is obvious when it is recalled that one always discharges sputum in coughing and nasal fluids in sneezing. After liquefaction, toxins in the body below the neck are discharged as night sweating. Headaches are caused by liquefied toxins seeking a way out of the body and stimulating the nerves to cause pain. These toxins are striving to reach the lungs, from which they will be expelled in the form of sputum. When we administer Johrei for headaches, coughing and expectoration of sputum are instantaneous, and relief from pain follows. Because human beings often bend their arms and legs, toxins accumulate in the joints, where purification results in pain. As this explanation makes clear, sickness is the process of cleaning pollutants from the human body. It can therefore be said that there is no greater blessing than the common cold, or sickness in general. The cause of poor health is accumulated pollutants. Sickness is the process whereby those pollutants are cleansed away and good health is restored. The suffering of sickness is blessed since it is a cleansing process. If left alone, it will not be severe. Medical science views pain as an evil and attempts to halt it. By preventing the emergence of matter that naturally ought to be expelled from the body, this causes a collision between natural and artificial power and in this way intensifies the suffering. Obviously, medical science, which has developed under the delusion that suppressing natural processes in this way can work cures, is fundamentally in error. There is, however, a condition essential to the removal of the localized accumulation of toxins. Unless the body is vigorous enough to expel the toxins, that is, unless the metabolic processes are strong enough, purification cannot take place. Interpreting this in the opposite way, medical science attempts to suppress the emergence of purification. To do this, it must weaken both metabolism and health. Medicines are a way of weakening health. Fundamentally, medicines are poisons; they are effective precisely because they are poisonous. This may seem ludicrous, yet a dose of medicine in fact weakens the body. Weakening the body weakens the purification process, which in turn reduces suffering. Established medical science deludes itself by assuming it is the medicine that has cured the illness. The same can be said for other so-called therapies. Applying ice packs to the head to reduce fever only rehardens those toxins that had started to liquefy. Total rest with no exercise of any kind is the most effective possible way to weaken the body. Even people in good health will suffer ill effects if forced to remain still for several months without exercising their bodies. Their stomachs will weaken, they will lose their appetites, their arms and legs will be debilitated by lack of use, and they will find themselves on the verge of serious illness. Clearly the case is much graver with a sick person who is deprived of all exercise. Wet poultices also weaken the body. Human beings breathe, not only through the mouth and nose, but also through the capillaries dispersed throughout the skin of the whole body. Poultices stop dermal breathing wherever they are applied. This lowers fever and relieves suffering, but it stops the purification process in the vicinity of the poultice. (Date uncertain) 045. Medicine Toxins I I shall now go on to explain the grave danger of medicine toxins, in general aside from what I call the "hereditary toxins." In all ages and all places, it has been considered sensible to take medicine when ill, just as it is to eat when hungry. The idea that medicines cure is deeply ingrained. Yet I have realized that medicines are fearsome poisons that totally lack power to cure sickness. Indeed, they cause illness in the sense that they are its source.* Some people may find this difficult to understand, but it is true. I once read in a book the following words of a noted Chinese-style doctor: "Fundamentally there are no medicines; they are all poisons. Taking medicine for an illness is the same thing as attempting to control one poison by means of another." This is a very wise thing to say and reminiscent of the old proverb about "making medicines out of poisonous herbs." When pain is intolerable, relief can of course be had by means of, say, morphine injections. Yet as medical scientists know full well, the relief is brought about only by a temporary paralysis of the nerves caused by the poison called morphine. I have explained earlier that sickness arises as a result of the process of purification, which is always accompanied by the suffering referred to as illness. Obviously, everyone dislikes suffering and wants to escape from it quickly. There are two ways to eliminate suffering. One way to get rid of it completely is by totally expelling from the body those toxins that must be removed. The other is a temporary escape and a return to the condition predating the occurrence of suffering; this means, merely, halting the purification process and returning to the condition existing before its initiation. Since the complete elimination of toxins is a natural process, it takes time. It is the desire to be free of suffering quickly that has stimulated the development of all the medical and other therapeutic methods invented in the past. Moreover, medical science has never yet understood the principle of toxin elimination and purification as the true nature of illness. 1939 *Though medicines are capable of extending life temporarily and of creating a condition of false good health, they cannot bring about a fundamental cure. Essential good health is a condition in which human beings can live without medicine. For this reason, it is important to avoid taking medicines as much as possible, though sometimes respect for human life makes their application necessary. 046. Medicine Toxins II When people become sick they develop fever, pain, and general malaise or may cough and expectorate sputum. If they take medicine they will feel better, just as if the medicine had cured the sickness. But, as I have often said, taking the poison called medicine weakens the whole body. Because the body weakens, the purification process grows faint, and pain is eased. If this were all, the situation would not be so bad. The truly serious problem is what happens to the poison after one has taken it. Let me explain. The ingestion of poison stimulates an antidotal process, or one that eliminates the harmful substance. This is true of toxins in the foods we eat, but the body is powerless to counteract immediately poisons other than those in our foods. Since the poison from the medicines that people take is not completely eliminated, some remains to accumulate in the body. Just as in the case of toxins that have been handed down through generations of medicine users, these newly introduced toxins accumulate in areas where nerves are plentiful; when purification and elimination of accumulated hardened toxins of the kind that are most difficult to expel from the body begin, medicine toxins halt the process and increase toxic levels. This is the effect of medicinal therapy. A second-stage accumulation of toxins develops. Then purification begins again; but this time, owing to the increased amount of toxins, the purifying process is a greater strain. This is why secondary purification, or repurification, is more severe than the initial process. Furthermore, third-stage and fourth-stage purification can occur. 1939 047. Low-grade Fever Though only some people are aware of it, probably no one today is without what is called low-grade fever. Because of the surprisingly great influence it has on the human body, I shall now discuss this kind of fever. A persistent slight fever causes headaches, heaviness in the head, lack of psychological concentration, distraction, diminished memory, loss of perseverance, laziness in everything, sluggishness of the whole body, and a desire to lie around and doing nothing. It reduces the appetite and makes people finicky about what they eat. When afflicted with it, people show a preference for liquids and foods with high liquid content. They may be irritable, shut off from the world, jaded, and pessimistic. They become hysterical, are negative in outlook, and prefer rainy to fair weather. They catch cold easily and are prone to stuffy nose, ringing in the ears, and tonsillitis. They become short of breath and suffer heaviness in the legs from walking fast or climbing slopes. As this brief summary of its effects clearly shows, a low-grade fever is not something to take lightly. Because of these symptoms, such people do not mix well with their friends or get along smoothly with other people. Their marital and other relationships are poor because such people insist on acting precisely as they wish and always have some kind of justification for their own selfish behavior; "liberalism" is one of their favorite excuses. Because such people are dissatisfied with life at home, horrible things often happen in their lives. The currently increasing numbers of young people who run away from home may well be influenced by this kind of domestic situation. In the worst cases, entire families have been known to commit suicide together. On a social level, large numbers of people concerned with nothing but pursuing and justifying their own selfish ends disrupt harmony, debate unimportant matters, and resort to conflict to solve issues that could be solved amicably. Egotism of this kind is apparently common in the world of politics. Whenever something is being debated in a group, there is so much bustle and commotion that it takes a long time to come to an agreement; the reason is not so much that people are unaware of the cause as that they are indifferent to it. But there is still more to the matter. As society becomes disturbed in the ways I have described above, people experience more unpleasant than pleasant things, and seek diversion by turning to alcohol; this is why the sale of alcoholic beverages, no matter how much they cost, continues unabated. Next, such people seek still stronger stimuli in the hope of escaping from their suffering. Young people seek unwholesome amusements. Older people with the money to pay for such things keep mistresses or seek consolation in the red-light districts. For this reason, the world today is filled with such unhealthy amusements. Clearly, then, nothing is so fearsome as a low-grade fever, which is the fundamental cause of trouble in all these aspects of life. The presence in the body of medicine toxins is the cause of the slight fever, which is a sign of the slow purification process taking place in the body to eliminate these hardened toxins. Since Johrei is the only way to work a cure, an increase in the number of people who do Johrei will eliminate the deplorable situation I have described above. When this happens, society will be a pleasant, happy place in which to live; and we will have an ideal world. September 5, 1951 048. Balanced Purification The person who administers Johrei must remember the principle of "balanced purification." For example, pain in the right arm may disappear, but then develop in the left arm. The pain seems to move from one arm to the other, but this is really an example of balanced purification: cleansing must take place in an equalized fashion. Thus, when toxins have been purified out of the right arm, a parallel natural purification may start in the left arm if there are toxins there. Obviously this pertains not only to the arms, but also to other parts of the body. Pain does not shift from the abdomen to the back. The appearance of a shift is only the result of the balanced purification I speak of. April 22, 1950 049. The Word Purification (Johka) The word "purification" which we use for illness is, I feel, peculiarly apt, not least because it exactly expresses the truth. It has, to begin with, a very pleasant sound, whereas the word sickness is unpleasantness itself. Yet even the word for sickness, in Japanese, is hardly a mistake. The two characters for it, byo and ki, mean "sickness" and "mind," and the trouble is precisely that people fret their minds about sickness too much without realizing that it is, essentially, a good thing. In this connection, I am encouraged and delighted when I hear members saying to each other, for example, "I'm pleased to say that purification has started," or "Thanks to purification, I feel much better now," or "Purification is a true blessing." Though I dislike it very much, the word byoin (hospital) is an apt description of the institution: a place (in) where incurable illness (byo) continues for a long time. If we in this organization were asked to give a name to a place where illness is treated, we would probably call it a johin, or place of purification. If people stopped taking medicines, the only illnesses that would remain would be simple ones that could be cured at home; and there would be no need to build hospitals of any kind. May21, 1952 050. Admonitions from Ancestral Spirits Because they sincerely hope for the happiness and prosperity of their descendants, ancestral spirits are ceaselessly sending them warnings to prevent their making mistakes and doing evil that runs contrary to their own well-being, and to help them avoid falling into negative ways. When their posterity left in this world are lured by evil forces into doing something wrong, the ancestral spirits inflict all kinds of calamity and illness on them both as a warning and as expiation for sins already committed. For example, a person who has made a fortune by dishonest means will be made to suffer fire and loss that destroy all his property. With some sins, again, purification by illness is carried out. Such admonitions manifest themselves in various ways. For example, it may happen that an infant or a child undergoes purification in the form of a cold － a simple illness that Johrei should be able to cure easily － yet nothing has any effect. Perplexingly, the child begins to vomit a great deal; loses appetite; rapidly declines and dies. This is an admonition from the ancestral spirits of the kind already described, necessitated by, say, the child's father's marital infidelity or by his keeping a mistress. Where the man fails to understand the first time such a warning is delivered, his other children are taken from him one by one. It is lamentable in the extreme that a man should thus sacrifice the life of a dear child for fleeting moments of pleasure. In a case of this kind, the spirits hesitate to take the life of the father, who is the mainstay of the whole family, and are compelled to take the child in his stead. Here is an interesting illustration of such an admonition. The head of a family, about forty at the time, was disinclined to worship in front of the family Buddhist shrine; this disturbed his daughter, who discussed the matter with her father's younger brother. As an outcome of these talks, the family shrine was transferred from the house of the older to that of the younger brother. The younger man began to worry about what might happen in the future and went again to his older brother's house to request him to write a clear statement of the shrine's transfer. The older brother agreed and took pen and paper in preparation, but in the very instant in which he was about to write, he had a spasm of the hands, and his tongue was paralyzed. He was unable to write or say anything. Various kinds of treatments were tried on this man, but to no avail. Finally he came for help to one of my disciples, who related the daughter's story of the family shrine to me. The ancestors delivered this admonition to the older brother as head of the family's main branch, because, while willing to permit the transfer of the shrine temporarily to the home of the younger brother, they could not countenance a permanent transfer, since this would upset the family lineage and could result in severance of the family line. February 5, 1947 051. Rebirth There is a great deal of latitude in the speed with which people are reborn, depending on the will of the person involved. A person who is very attached to this world at the moment of death will be reborn quickly. But the effects of such a speedy return are not good. The deepest purification takes place in the spiritual world. Therefore, the longer one is there, the purer one's spiritual being becomes, and the more fortunate one's circumstances at rebirth. If rebirth is fast, pollutants remain and must be purified away during life by means of an unfortunate fate filled with sickness, poverty, and disaster. This is the situation that determines why some people are born fortunate whereas others are born unfortunate. Good and bad fortune are in no way accidental but are inevitably determined by the degree of purification in the spiritual world. There is still another determining factor: the sincerity and thoroughness with which survivors hold memorial services for the spirit of the departed. Moreover, the fervor with which survivors and descendants help others, work for the welfare of society and the nation, and accumulate virtue, stimulates the purification of ancestors. This means that filial piety is not limited to this life. On the contrary, the prayers offered and good deeds performed after the death of one's parents can be even more important than care shown during life. It is only people ignorant of the nature of the spiritual world who say, "By the time I was ready to be good to them, my parents were no longer alive to enjoy it." People who are reborn before their purification in the spiritual world is complete are sometimes physically deformed or disabled. To take one example, one may be born with a deformity of an arm or leg because one has broken a limb in a fall, then been reborn before it has had time to heal. There are cases in which the devotion and attachment of survivors influence the speed with which a person is reborn. Women not infrequently become pregnant again soon after the death of a beloved child. This may be because the devotion and longing of the mother have greatly accelerated rebirth of the infant. For precisely this reason, such children are usually not very happy. October 23, 1943 052 The Spiritual World I should now like to discuss in more detail the way in which modern civilization is based, as needs no pointing out, on materialistic science. First of all, it is necessary here to understand the structure of the universe itself. I shall concentrate on the major points, and on those particular matters that are related directly to human beings. Basically, the universe consists of three elements: the sun, the moon, and the earth. These three elements are the essences of fire, water, and soil, and manifest themselves as the spiritual realm, the air realm, and the phenomena realm; reality is a complete fusion and harmony of these three. Hitherto, people have understood only the realms of air and phenomena (the material realms) and have been ignorant of the existence of another, the spiritual realm which material science was unable to understand. Modern civilization is only two-thirds of what it should be because it has been produced by progress in only two of the basic elements. As long as this other element is ignored, a perfect civilization cannot evolve, since that element is at the heart of all basic power and is far more important than the other two combined. This statement is clearly illustrated by our culture, a culture that has not been able to ensure happiness, humanity's sole desire, despite all its material development. A close examination of the fundamentals of this paradox reveals a profound truth. If mankind had understood the existence of the spiritual world from the outset material civilization would not have achieved the kind of wonderful development it manifests today. Ignoring the spiritual realm gave birth to atheism, and from atheism, much evil was born. The resulting struggle between good and evil has caused man to suffer, and has thus relentlessly stimulated the development of material civilization. Deep thought on the matter shows that this can only be God's plan. Now, however, having developed to a certain level, materialism threatens to bring about the destruction of civilization. The invention of the atomic bomb vividly illustrates the truth of this. The time has come to make a great turnabout in our thinking concerning the advance of civilization. The first step must be to make clear to all people the existence of the spiritual world, which hitherto had been considered nonexistent. Since it is in fact intangible, of course, it is impossible to deal with it through science. The only way is through a manifestation of the power of God, a power greater than anything humanity has experienced in the past. Even so, it is difficult to convince modern humanity, which has for so long and so stubbornly stressed the materialist view of this power. It is here that the central miracle of our faith comes to the fore, the method of Johrei where by the most confirmed atheist finds himself convinced at once. When it becomes known to all humanity, a true worldwide civilization will come into being and modern culture will do a great about-face. Even so, a troublesome problem remains to be solved. During the tens of thousands of years it has taken to produce modern civilization, an untold amount of evil has been committed. Pollutants of the spiritual body have accumulated to the point that, unless something is done about them, they will hinder the building of a new world. Just as it is essential to sweep up the wood shavings and lumber scraps on the site of a new building, so these pollutants must be cleaned away. Such a cleaning-up process may be what Christ meant by the Last Judgment. It is a fact that with Johrei we have performed innumerable miracles. To make the existence of the spiritual world known to all people － this, surely, is God's plan, and God has laid the great responsibility for it on my shoulders. July 4, 1951 053 The Great World Transition I shall now explain in detail how the Johrei that I originated came into being, and why no one else has so far realized the causes of sickness and the uselessness of almost all existing therapeutic methods. The universe is composed of some things as limitless as the sky and others so minute that they cannot be seen even under a microscope; all these things, in accordance with their size and composition, come into being, develop, combine and separate, aggregate, disintegrate, and rebuild in a process of eternal development. Just as each of these things has a yin and a yang aspect, so there is the difference between night and day in a single day, and a cold period and a warm period in each year, and so it continues for ten years, one hundred years, one thousand years, or ten thousand years. Yet, naturally, once every several thousand years, there occurs a transition of day to night and night to day. The time for such a transition is coming now. Indeed, today corresponds to the dawning of such a period. The reader may be puzzled by this statement, since he is likely to think of night and day as part of a regular 24-hour cycle. However, it can be explained quite easily. The world in which we live consists of three stages: the spiritual world, the air world, and the world of phenomena. These can also be grouped into two stages: the water element － air － and the soil element － the globe itself － are physical, whereas the fire element － the spirit － is totally nonphysical. In this case, the last-named corresponds to the spiritual world and the former two to the physical world. To understand the relation between the spiritual world and the physical world, it is essential to know that all phenomena arise first in the spiritual world and are transmitted to the physical world. In metaphorical terms, the spiritual world is the motion-picture film, while the actual world is what appears projected on the screen. This is a strict law of the universe. In the case of the human being, the invisible mind moves first, then the arms and legs move at its command. It is impossible that the arms and legs should move first and then the mind. The spiritual world corresponds to the mind, and the physical world to the arms and legs. The night and day cycles which occur once in thousands or tens of thousands of years are occurrences in the spiritual world. For a long time, the world has been in a state of night, but it is about to be transformed into a world of day. The ancient Japanese history known as the Kojiki prophesies this in the story of the sun goddess Amaterasu Omikami, who concealed herself in a cave, thus plunging the world into darkness, but later emerged to bring daylight again. In my opinion, the idea of the Light from the East, long popular in the West, is nothing other than this prophecy. October 23, 1943 054. Transition from Night to Day All occurrences in the physical world are projections of occurrences in the spiritual world. Everything becomes clear if it is realized that a great transition has recently been taking place in the spiritual world. From God's point of view essentially all things in the universe are created and destroyed as a result of the action of both the spiritual and the actual worlds in an unending process of development in the material world that ranges from the limitless universe to the most minute particles. It is these unending changes that give rise to unceasing cultural progress and development. Calm and quiet reflection on this cannot but inspire one with a sense of the universal will, of the purpose of God. In all things, there are distinctions between in and yang, dark and light, night and day. These variations, as well as those of the seasons of the year and of the growth and decline observable in all things, relate to human life as much as to all other phenomena. The distinctions observable among all things, of all sizes, are to be seen in time too. For instance, just as a twenty-four hour span is divided into day and night, so each year, decade, century, millennium, has a day and a night. These larger days and nights, however, are phenomena of the spiritual world. To the actual world only the day-and-night division of a twenty-four hour span is observable. The time for the change from night to day that must happen in the spiritual world every so many thousands or tens of thousands of years has now arrived. Unless one understands this important fact, it is impossible to grasp the principles of Johrei. At the same time, knowledge of this truth makes it possible to see the future of the world and inspires serenity of mind. Next, then, I shall explain how this change in the spiritual world from night to day － a change that takes place only once in thousands of years － affects the physical world. Hitherto, the spiritual world has been experiencing a night that, like night in the actual world, is a dark broken only by periods of moonlight. Of course, when the element of water is abundant and the moon is concealed, only the stars shine. When the stars are clouded over, the darkness is complete. The effects of this state are clear in the physical world, which is simply a reflection of the spiritual world. The alternating periods of order and disorder, war and peace, in the nations of the world in the past have been very much like the waxing and waning of the moon. Now the time has come where dark must give way to light; we are entering a period that can be likened to dawn. As an outcome of this transition in the spiritual world, humanity will experience an immense, awe-inspiring, and joyful transformation of a kind never known before. Harbingers of this transition have already appeared on the scene. Like day in the actual world, the new day of which I am speaking will begin with the appearance of the sun's orb in the east. Now, in the Far East － in Japan, the land of the rising sun － a great revolution is taking place. The destruction of the existing culture of night is starting in this country. This is the reason for the total destruction of our major cultural cities, the reduction of our industry and economy to dire straits, and the general abolition of the privileged and ruling classes. Signs of the construction of a new culture － the culture of day － have already appeared. Following complete disarmament, democracy is coming into being in Japan. Both phenomena are unprecedented in the 2,600 years that have passed since the founding of the Japanese nation. More than unprecedented, they were also un foreseeable. They are a first step in the establishment of world peace. In contrast to the world of night, characterized by war, hunger, and suffering, the world of day will be a time brilliant with peace, abundance, and good health. The Japan of the present shows we are at the turning point. The sun that is now rising in the eastern heavens will eventually reach its zenith. What will that mean? Obviously it will mean the overall destruction of the culture of night. What is more, it will signify the birth of the culture of day. Since Japan can already show a little of that culture, this much is easy to prophesy. The fate of the world is bearing down heavily on us at the present. No one win be able to escape from this framework; the only course open to us is to find a way to minimize the suffering we must face. Such a way is at hand in an understanding of our principles of Johrei and in participation in the development of the culture of day. The Bible says, "And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached throughout the whole world, as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come." I believe this to signify that my writings must fulfill this mission. In explaining the principles of Johrei I have gone so far as to explain the fate of the world because this is very important. Discovery of the principles of Johrei and discovery of the fallacy of medical science both depend basically on the one point of converting night into day. The cause of sickness is clouds in the spiritual body. Eliminating those clouds is the sole condition for the cure of sickness. Why then was this not known before the discovery of Johrei? The reason is that there are two ways to treat sickness. One is to bring about a return to the state before purification of toxins started; that is, rehardening the toxins. The other is to liquefy the toxins and eliminate them. As the reader will understand well by now, established medical science employs the first method, whereas Johrei employs the second. One of the principles of Johrei is that the human body radiates an invisible, mystical light that is a spiritual essence peculiar to the human body and that consists basically of the element of fire. Channeling of Johrei demands large amounts of the element of fire, which will gradually increase in quantity in the spiritual world as the latter moves into the period of day, since the sun is the basic source of fire-element radiation. Aside from its value in healing, an increased quantity of the element of fire is equally important because it will stimulate the purification process in the human body. Change in the spiritual world will directly influence the spiritual body. Increasing the amount of the fire element will play, as it were, a supplementary role in encouraging purification of the clouds in the spiritual body. Sickness will therefore occur more easily, and established medical therapy, which depends on hardening the toxins, will lose some and finally, all of its efficacy. For instance, whereas in the age of darkness it took several years before the toxins, once hardened, became active again, in the age of light this period will gradually shorten to a year, then half a year, and so on until in the end hardening of the toxins actually becomes impossible. We are gradually moving into the world of day. In the world of night, the toxin hardening, and not the toxin-liquefying method of treating sickness has prevailed because the element of fire needed for toxin-liquefaction has been available in insufficient amounts. This has made it seem necessary to settle for the toxin-hardening method as the best substitute. But this was a grave mistake that has been the cause of shortened life spans, illness, hunger, war, and other sufferings. February 5, 1947 055. I Am a Scientist of the Spirit Though it might sound odd for me, a specialist in religion to describe myself as a scientist, yet anyone who reads this to the end will be convinced that the description is accurate. As I often say, modern science is still on a level too low to be called science at all. Contemporary science places maximum stress on the discovery and investigation of particles. Sophistication of the microscope has made possible astounding advances in humanity's understanding of extremely minute particles. We are capable of investigating things magnified thousands, even millions of times, and possibilities for further development seem infinite. The word spirit, which has come into popular usage in recent years, probably refers to this limitless world. It is not scientific operations as such, of course, by hypotheses deduced from the results of research into scientific theories that have enabled us to learn about this world; without such hypotheses, efforts to understand it would have been futile. This infinite world is the same thing as the spiritual world that I teach. Science, which in reality has long denied the spiritual, has now been obliged to recognize it. By coming to a more accurate appreciation of the spiritual world, science has suddenly raised itself to an elevated position and taken a step forward in the scholarly search for ideal truth. In its early period, science concentrated on the physical; in its latter period, it will concentrate on the spiritual. The emergence of such a science on the world stage signifies a 180-degree turn, bringing science into agreement with religion. To make this still easier to understand, let us imagine a line drawn through the center of the world of science. Material science is below that line, and spiritual science above it. The former concerns itself with external content, and the latter with internal content. It is a matter for great rejoicing that science should have moved from the material, where it was a science of existence, to the spiritual, where it is a science dealing with things without physical existence. A serious problem still remains, however. It is not enough simply to understand the spiritual world. Its essence must be grasped and then made useful to humanity. Physical science has no method capable of doing this. To deal with the spiritual, it is essential to employ the spiritual. In my opinion, this difficulty can easily be overcome. Indeed, it has already been overcome in my work with astonishing results. In cases of curing sickness I am using the spirit to solve spiritual problems. To explain briefly: since impurities accumulated in the patient's spirit are the sources of all illness － according to the firm law that the spiritual precedes the physical － removing these impurities necessarily effects a cure. The method where by this cure is effected is to use a special kind of spiritual radiation － it might be called a spiritual atomic bomb － to burn away the impurities. This method, which we call Johrei, is a sophisticated scientific operation worthy of being called a "super-science," since it solves problems that medicine, science, and religion have heretofore found irresolvable. Since the inferior cannot overcome the superior, a solution of the high-level problems of human life by means of low-level material science is impossible. This is proved by the ease with which Johrei can cure illnesses that medical science has given up as hopeless. Spiritual science could be called the inner essence of physical science. Let us now examine more thoroughly the nature of the spiritual world. Essentially, the spiritual world is made up of the essences of sun, moon, and the earth, a union of what science refers to as oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen, and what we call the fire element, the water element, and the soil element. Earth is the basic form of the material world; sun, of the spirit; moon, of the air. Sun and moon control the atmosphere, which fills all spaces on the earth. The fire element, though the strongest, is also the rarest of the three. For this reason, while understanding heat and light, science has not yet grasped the nature of the fire element as a spirit. Since science has concentrated solely on the elements of water and soil, it is these that characterize modern civilization; this is its greatest failing. At this point I have to describe a major, startling change that the world is due to undergo. The world, as we have seen, is composed of the three elements of sun, moon, and earth. In terms of physical phenomena, the alternation of the sun and the moon signifies the change from day to night A similar division between day and night exists in the spiritual world, even though material science cannot understand it. Spiritual science, on the other hand, can understand it. The great change which must take place in the world is a transition of a startling kind humanity has never previously considered. It is now about to begin. It is a historical change, an expansion of day and night that can only be comprehended in terms of time itself. In the spiritual world, alternation of day and night takes place once in ten, a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand years. Just as the planet earth is composed of the three elements of fire, water, and soil, so all universal space is based on the number three. According to this immutable law of the universe, day and night last three years, thirty years, three hundred years, three thousand years, and so on. Of course, there are differences in the speed with which the transfer from spirit to material being is made depending on the nature and size of the thing in question. Nonetheless, in general, everything mows according to the law. Surprisingly enough, the great transition that must take place once in three thousand years is about to happen now － now is its dawning. As I have written previously, the very date of the transition is clearly known: since June 15, 1931 the world has been in its day phase. Though the transition has been made in the spiritual world, it is gradually being transferred to the physical world and will eventually become a reality. As the spiritual world enters the day phase, the quantity of fire element will increase. This too will gradually be reflected in the physical world, and the situation prevailing until the present in which water has taken precedence over fire will be reversed; fire will take precedence over water. No physical science can explain this, yet people of enlightenment will understand fully. Problems that have necessarily gone without solutions in the past can now be readily solved. In this way, my idea is to elevate physical science from its present low level to the point where it can help to create a true civilization. April 7, 1954 056. The Precedence of the Spiritual over the Physical Because it is materially oriented, and concentrates solely on visible, tangible objects, modern science understands only the outer surfaces of things and pays no attention at all to an important inner reality. The "reality" in question, which might well seem a kind of non-existence, is what is known as the spirit. As long as science fails to realize that the spirit is the main constituent of all things, its advances will be limping and partial, no matter how much progress it makes. Nor can it be expected to give rise to a true civilization. Once this is clearly understood, all the unsolvable problems of the past will be easily solved, since the law that the spiritual takes precedence over the physical is universal. To take one example, the invisible will is responsible for the motion of the limbs and other parts of the human body. The body does not move on its own. No matter how miraculous it may seem, it is necessary to understand that the original cause arises in the spirit and is then transferred to the body. I shall now explain this in relation to sickness, in which the principle is most easily understood. Though it is manifest as phenomena in the body, illness has, of course, its origin in the spirit. In other words, a cloudiness first occurs in one or several parts of the spirit, then is reflected in the body as illness, so that to get rid of the clouds obviously means curing the sickness. As long as the cause of the sickness is in the spirit, medical science's practice of treating only the physical symptoms cannot effect a true cure. It is essential to realize this as quickly as possible and make a new start. Happily, God has entrusted to me the immense responsibility of revising and correcting the mistakes of medical science. The responsibility is all the greater in that the error goes beyond medical science and extends to all aspects of our civilization. Let me give an example. The many crimes that occur today are, like sickness, only surface manifestations. Their causes, like those of illness, are to be found in the spirit or the soul. Nonetheless, as in treating sickness, people remain unaware of the true causes and attempt to deal with crime by treating the symptoms only; in other words, through punishment. Such treatment, however, is only temporary, and crimes continue as numerous as the sands on a beach. People should realize that the remodeling of the soul essential to their elimination can be achieved only through religion. As I have shown, failure to take the spirit into account is behind these two major problems. Miracles are a method of making this thoroughly understood. September 10, 1953 057. The Precedence of the Spiritual over the Physical Let us consider the relation between the non-material world and physical illness. By "non-material world" I refer to what we call the spiritual world. In human beings there is unity between the body and the spirit. The body is visible and physical. The spirit is invisible to the eye, but it exists as a kind of ether. The human body belongs to the realm of air, and the human spirit to the spiritual world. As previously stated, the spiritual world is a transparent entity still more rarefied than air. In this, it might seem similar to non-existence, yet in fact, far from being nonexistent it is a source of absolute and infinite power, a realm of unimaginably mysterious depths compounded of the essences of sun, moon, and earth. I shall tentatively refer to it here as "universal power." This universal power brings all things into being and stimulates their growth and development but this process accumulates pollution, and a purification process takes place to eliminate the pollutants. This is very much like bathing, which human beings use to remove the dirt and grime accumulating on their bodies. Pollutants accumulating in specific localities in the spiritual world of the planet earth stimulate the development of low-pressure cells that perform a cleansing and purifying function. Fires, whether caused by lightning or by human agency, perform the same kind of function. It is the same with human beings, of course when pollutants accumulate, the spirit takes the lead in initiating a purification process. I shall now examine this in detail. The pollutants － or clouds － that accumulate in the human spirit create opaque spots on the essentially transparent spiritual body. There are two causes for this: clouds arising in the spirit itself and clouds transferred to the spirit from the physical body. I shall begin my explanation with the former. The spirit consists of three layers which converge in the center. The innermost is called the soul － the tiny entity that, in terms of human birth, is first transferred by the man to lodge in the womb of the woman. However, since the soul is enclosed by the mind which is itself enclosed by the spirit, conditions in the soul are transferred to the spirit by way of the mind, and in reverse, conditions in the spirit are reflected on the soul by way of the mind. In short, the soul mind, and spirit are simultaneously three and one. As long as they are alive, all human beings do both good and evil. When the bad outweighs the good, the difference is sin that reflects as clouds on the soul. Then the mind and the spirit, in this order, become cloudy too. The clouds are removed when the following purification process begins. Accumulated clouds contract and condense and gather in certain localities in the body. Interestingly, the location differs according to the nature of the sin. For instance, sin committed through the eye causes accumulation in the eye; sins committed through the head, accumulations in the head; and sins committed through the chest, accumulations in the chest Let us consider now the reverse case, where clouds are transferred from the physical body to the spirit. In this case, the murkiness develops in the blood before transference to the spirit. Since the blood is the physical manifestation of the spirit and the spirit, conversely, a spiritual manifestation of the blood, the body and spirit are one. Conversely, transference of concentrated clouds to the body causes murkiness in the blood; when this becomes still further condensed, it hardens; and when the resulting hardness is liquefied and seeks outlets from various parts of the body, the suffering caused is what is known as sickness. Transference from the body, thus, refers to the transference of the blood's murkiness. The question, then, is what causes this murkiness. Surprisingly enough, it is the medicine that forms the mainstay of medical therapy. Since all medicine is poison, introduction of medicine into the body causes clouds in the blood,* as facts prove better than anything else. Because of the toxic nature of medicine, it is scarcely surprising that, while being subjected to medical treatment, illnesses often linger, worsen, or give rise to pathological side effects. If clouds in the physical blood are reflected as clouds in the spirit and if this in turn is the cause of sickness, the way to cure sickness itself is the same as the way to cause sickness. It is a universally applicable law that the spiritual takes precedence over the physical. For this reason, unless the clouds in the spirit are removed, the illness resulting from them cannot be completely cured. Our therapy is an application of this law in that we fundamentally cure illness by purifying the spirit through Johrei. Ignorant of this, medical science tries to cure the body only while ignoring the spirit. Consequently, no matter how much progress it makes, it remains capable of temporary cures only. August 15, 1951 *Though medicine may prolong life and may produce people who are apparently, though not actually healthy, it lacks the power to effect fundamental cures. Human health in its original form is the ability to live without medicine. For this reason, it is important to avoid taking medicines as much as possible. There are, however, cases in which very grave illness makes resort to medicine unavoidable. 058. The Spiritual Body and the Physical Body It is a fundamental principle that in all things the spiritual takes precedence over the physical; once this principle is understood, many so-called miracles become comprehensible. It is, however, necessary to understand first the relation between the spiritual world and the physical world. Human beings may be clad in a fleshy raiment, but they also have a spiritual raiment (aura). The aura is a kind of ether or light reflected from the spirit; and, though it is vague, there are people who can see it with their ordinary eyes. Like the weather, the aura is constantly changing from clear to cloudy and from cloudy to clear. If the person thinks good and does good, the spirit is clear; but if he thinks evil and does evil, it becomes cloudy. Thus belief in a true deity sheds a light that helps to dispel the clouds, whereas worship of a false deity only increases them. Ordinary people who lack knowledge of spiritual matters tend to think that any god is a true god. This is a great error. Actually, false gods are more numerous than true gods. Proof of this is to be seen in families that, despite generations of ardent faith, suffer an endless line of misfortunes. The deities such people worship are either false or weak. When a person puts his faith in a true god, however, and accumulates merit as a consequence of his own efforts to save others, his light increases, and his aura widens. The aura of an ordinary person may be about 3 centimeters wide. That of a good and virtuous person may be from 15 to 30 centimeters wide, while that of someone with a godlike personality and immense merit may be many miles in width. That of a great religious leader will extend throughout a number of peoples and lands, as is true in the cases of Christ and the Buddha A savior of the world has the astounding power to encompass all humanity with his light, though history shows that no such savior has appeared in the world so far. The attitude and effort of the individual determines the width of his or her aura. People should believe this and seek to accumulate as much virtue as possible. Members of our organization are often saved from disaster by their auras. For instance, a wide aura may prevent the spirit of an oncoming automobile from reaching a person even if it should strike him. In similar circumstances, people with thin auras or none at all may be killed or suffer severe injury. The case is similar with good and bad luck. Things are organized so that the human body belongs to the physical world, and the spirit to the spiritual world. The spiritual world is made up of upper, middle, and lower zones, each of which is divided into three stages. Each of these stages is further divided into twenty levels for a total of one hundred and eighty levels in all. Of course, the lower zone is hell. The middle zone is the world of being, or a realm of the same caliber as our ordinary world. The upper zone is paradise. Ordinary people dwell in the middle zone but can move either upward or downward depending on whether their actions are good or evil. Furthermore, the spiritual world, unlike the actual world, is utterly fair without the least partiality of any kind. Though this is a disadvantage to the wicked, it is a true joy for people of true faith. The world of hell, of course, is a turmoil of jealousy, resentment, envy, hatred, and poverty. These traits the Buddhists call greed, anger, and folly, all of which increase in intensity as they descend through the levels. The very bottom realm is said to be a hell of utter darkness and cold. All this does not pertain only to the world after death. Happiness and unhappiness in this actual world depend on the individual's position in the spiritual world. The numerous reported cases of entire families who, after having been driven to extremities of suffering, commit suicide together, reveal the way the realm of hell in the spiritual world is reflected on the actual world. Since such suffering ultimately stems from evil which the person himself has perpetrated, no one is as foolish as the deliberate wrongdoer. Even people who seem temporarily to have gotten ahead in the world as a consequence of evil acts must sooner or later come to grief because they are placed in hell in the spiritual world. The reverse, too, is true. If a person does good and if his position in the spiritual world improves, it is an inviolable, divine law that happiness will one day come his way, no matter how much he suffers now. Although teaching this principle is the essential mission of religion, it has not done so thoroughly until the present time, the reason being the emphasis on scriptures and preaching at the expense of the really important thing; actual demonstration － that is, miracles. But the time has come. The Supreme God will manifest his absolute powers and through our organization will work startling miracles that will awaken humanity from its delusions and win the faith of all people. September 10, 1953 059. Spiritual Healing From various angles, I have explained that the world of day will be a world in which the spiritual precedes the physical. Toxins accumulated as material substances in the human body are the fundamental causes of illness. In the spiritual being, clouds occur in zones corresponding to the areas in the physical body where these toxic accumulations take place. Elimination of the toxins from the physical being is a temporary measure only; the toxins will regenerate as time passes in accordance with the law that the spiritual precedes the physical. Consequently, the only correct method of achieving the ultimate aim of therapy is to remove the clouds from the spirit. This is the fundamental way to eliminate toxins. The very word relapse makes it clear that, by concentrating on the physical body and employing no methods other than elimination or hardening of physical toxins, past therapies have had only temporary and never fundamental results. As I have just indicated, medical science has only two ways of dealing with toxins: hardening them or surgically removing them. Folk remedies use electricity or light rays to harden toxins or moxa combustion to cause burns that concentrate and then eliminate suppuration. The therapy to which we subscribe, however, is based on the removal of clouds from the spirit by means of a kind of spiritual wave composed mainly of the fire element radiating from the hands and fingers of the person administering Johrei. I have tentatively named this wave the "mystic ray." Everyone has it to some degree. Perhaps it would be better to say that this ray boundlessly fills the space all around us － in short, the spiritual world. Why has no one in the past discovered the use of this spiritual ray to conduct therapy by eliminating clouds? It is because the world was in a night phase, in which the available light was limited to, roughly, that of the moon and it was impossible to obtain enough of the mystic ray to treat illness; that is, to remove clouds from the spirit. This is not to say that the ray was totally non-existent. As is well known, some religious people and faith practitioners have been able to win fame among people for their doctrines, and renown as founders of religious sects because their cures have had some effect. Nevertheless, since it is primarily composed of the water element, the light of the moon has been effective in dealing with only limited numbers of sicknesses and for only limited periods. Since the water element of moonlight is a cooling factor, it hardens toxins. Since it employs mainly the fire element, Johrei has the great effect in dissolving all kinds of toxins. Thus the following are the two fundamental motivations behind the discovery of my therapeutic method: the knowledge that the world is about to enter a transition from night to day, and the desire to effect great cures by radiating on pathologically affected parts of human bodies a powerful ray, thus causing the fire element, the molecules of which increase in the day phase of the world, to pass through the human body in great concentrations. October 23, 1943 060. The Principle of Johrei I The general educational level today makes explanation of this principle most difficult. There is nothing to be done about this, however, as long as education remains structured on materialism. In fact, however, the written records and traditions handed down by word of mouth of founders of virtually all religions include mention of miracles. This is especially the case in the great religions, because in those days performing miracles and producing beneficial results were sufficient to convince the masses, who had no desire to be told the principles of the miraculous things they beheld. It is obvious even now how many more people Jesus Christ would have saved in his lifetime and the great extent to which he would have been able to expand the limits of his teachings if it had not been for his crucifixion. The brevity of Christ's life was caused by the great power of Satan at that time. Satan's power was superior because, where the spiritual realm was concerned, the time was premature. Spiritual intuition tells me, however, that now the time is at last ripe for the great transition in the spiritual world and that Satan's power is weakening day by day. Divine revelations have made clear to me all the things that have puzzled the world in the past. Through this knowledge, I am striving to define clearly the true and false, elucidate the basic roots of good and bad, rectify all errors, and stimulate lively development of a spiritual culture to contrast with the materialistic culture that has progressed so haltingly in the past. In other words, by stimulating the simultaneous development of the spiritual and material cultures, I aim to create an ideal world, or paradise on earth. I shall explain some of the principles which enable members to get good results through startling miracles. As I have said, unlike uncivilized people or people living in a time of low cultural development, modern humanity is not inspired to faith by miracles alone. People today are unconvinced unless miracles have theoretical corroboration. Many older religions have gone into decline because they merely rejected materialistic culture and failed to bring actual benefit in this life to the people of the time. I shall now explain the Johrei method by means of which our members work miracles. Raising the hand and directing the palm toward a sick person immediately lightens difficult and serious illnesses. In a short time, intolerable pain is relieved or eliminated altogether. This can only be called miraculous. Over hundreds and thousands of years, outstanding scholars of many lands have studied and practiced to perfect modern medical science, and their meticulous and elaborate therapeutic methods deserve praise. For an ordinary person to successfully apply the Johrei method to cure sicknesses that have proved recalcitrant to therapy at the hands of medical authorities who have trained for decades at great expense, must be described as the wonder of the century. This is precisely what is meant by "the truth that transcends truth." It is understandable, since this is something without precedent in all history, that people who have done no more than hear such stories cannot accept what they hear, and that they regard the bearers of the tales as either superstitious or demented. If we were less than absolutely certain of what we can do, we would never have made such an ambitious and sweeping statement of purpose: "A world absolutely free of illness, poverty, and conflict." If we lacked the power to carry out this program we would be guilty of the un forgivable evil of deceiving the world. Miracles are not miraculous for us. They are phenomena that occur as the result of a particular process, and are capable of scientific corroboration. II Nothing is purely material; everything has a spiritual body that is invisible to the eye. Human beings are composed of a physical body and a spiritual body, which in very general terms correspond to the essences of the moon and earth and the essence of the sun, respectively. In simple terms, the spirit is fire, yang, male, exterior, vertical and diurnal. The body in contrast is water, yin, female, interior, horizontal, and nocturnal. Concentrating solely on the body, science has made the fundamental error of not recognizing the existence of the spirit. If they were body without spirit human beings would be matter only, as inanimate as trees and stones, devoid of both life and spiritual activity. Failure to understand this simple fact has been behind all the errors science has committed in the past. Scientists assume that space is occupied by nothing but air. Unfortunately science has not yet developed to the stage where it can discover the many invisible elements other than air that fill space. I Fortunately, however, I have been able to discover those invisible elements. call this approach "spiritual science." The discovery has led to the pioneering of an age in which humanity's greatest suffering, illness, will be totally eliminated. What, then, are the basic causes of sickness? The human being is composed of spirit and body. The two are inseparably joined, and the spirit enables the body to live and move. The spirit assumes a shape like that of the body. At its center is the mind; at the center of the mind is the soul. The operations of this three-in-one entity manifest themselves in the form of will and thought. Since it controls the body in the form of will and thought, the spiritual precedes the physical. In simple terms, when a human being moves his arms and legs, the limbs are motivated, not by themselves, but on the command of the will. The same is true of the eyes, the nose, the mouth, and all other parts of the body. To explain sickness in connection with this principle in a way that is readily understood, I shall take boils as an example. Almost everyone has experienced them. Generally, they begin as small eruptions, increase in size, become red, inflamed, and are painful or itchy at their head. They are a manifestation of the natural physiology of the body as it attempts to expel toxins. The body is naturally able to generate fever to liquefy toxins that have accumulated and localized, and then to discharge them in fluid form. To create an exit passage for the toxins, the skin becomes thinner and softer than usual. The redness of a boil is the toxic blood visible through skin that has become transparent. A short while later, a small hole opens, and liquefied toxins in the form of pus are expelled from the body. This is the end of the purification Process. This is the physical explanation. In the spirit, a kind of cloud corresponding to the boil develops. The graver the sickness, the denser the clouds. The clouds accumulate and localize in one part of the spirit. This is the ordinary purification process leading to the elimination of toxins from the entire spiritual body that have accumulated in one place. The purification, which is inseparably connected with the physical being, is what is called sickness. Not only the human body, but everything else in the universe is subject to the previously mentioned law that the spiritual precedes the physical. The purpose of Johrei is to eliminate clouds in the spirit. By means of Johrei, the clouds are rendered completely ineffective, their life is converted to death. "Dead" clouds are impotent and cannot irritate the nerves. Consequently, pain no longer exsists. III The Johrei method I use at present is to write the character for the word hikari (light) on pieces of paper, which exert their effect when worn on the person as focal points. When someone wearing a focal point administers Johrei, strong waves of light radiate from the ink with which the character is written, travel along the person's arm, and then radiate outward from the palm of his or her hand. The written characters for hikari give off light rays which are transmitted instantaneously to each one of them through "spiritual cords" from my body, just as radio waves are broadcast. To say that light waves are emitted from my spiritual body raises the question of what kind of mechanism there is in my spiritual being that can do this. The answer is simple: in my abdomen is a ball of light with an ordinary diameter of about 6 centimeters. There are people who have seen it. This ball of pure light emits limitless light rays. The source of this light is the cintamani gem of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, which, located in the spiritual world, directs its boundless light to me. This is called the divine power, the imponderable power, and the power of wondrous knowledge. The cintamani gem, or the jewel of satisfaction, held by the bodhisattva called Cintamanicakra-avalokiteshvara is the same as this one. IV Concerning the background of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara (or Kannon in Japanese), from ancient times this particular Buddhist deity was believed to have a unique, mysterious power. With God's permission I will some day reveal all of the mystery of this bodhisattva, but at present, the time is not ripe. I shall therefore set forth only as much as is necessary to Johrei. Of course, Avalokiteshvara has been active in Japan since the arrival of Buddhism, but until now that activity has been limited to salvation of the spirit. Avalokiteshvara conferred practical blessings when people prayed for them, but they were only of the most minor kind because, though the basic element of the light was a close union of the elements of fire and water, the element of soil was missing. Because it included only two elements, the light lacked full power in the conferring of benefits. But the time for the great transformation in the spiritual world has arrived － what the Bible calls the end of the world and the Last Judgment. For this reason the mightiest and most absolute power of salvation has become necessary. This power must include all three elements － of fire, water, and soil － the last-named being the element of matter which corresponds to the human body. The three-element composition is completed when soil is added by the passage of light through the body. The power of this three-in-one is the power of Avalokiteshvara. In simple terms, the light element emitted by the cintamani jewel of the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara passes through my body, thus becoming a manifestation of the bodhisattva's mystic power, which passes from me and through followers in our faith, becoming in turn the power of purification. I shall now use an example to explain this principle. In the past, people prayed for blessings to pictures or statues of Avalokiteshvara. But the Johrei performed by believers in our faith is capable of bestowing many times more blessings because the light waves emitted by statues and paintings consist of only two elements and lack the vital power of the physical body. The great transformation in the spiritual world, of which I am constantly speaking, is another reason. Before the middle of June 1931, the water element predominated in the spiritual world; the amount of the fire element was small. Since that time, however, the amount of the fire element has been gradually increasing. The transition actually started decades earlier, but at that time the element of fire was extremely rare. To explain the strength of the light, I might say that the light is strong when the fire element is abundant, just as an electric lamp of high candle power gives off strong heat. As another example, I am often told that I am much hotter than ordinary people because of the mass of the fire element in my abdomen. Each evening some of the people who serve me rub my shoulders and then always comment on the great heat they feel in my body. Even in winter, it is such that they often have to remove one or two outer garments. Everyone says that a room becomes warm by my being in it for a short time. I laughingly call myself a "substitute stove." In winter, after a bath, I am comfortable for an hour or two in nothing but a terrycloth robe. I greatly prefer bath water that is not too hot. The principle involved is like the one that increases heat when water is poured into a fire or that makes clear winter days colder than cloudy ones. May 30, 1949 061. Johrei and the Three-element Composition of the Internal Organs Among the internal organs, the function of the heart, lungs, and stomach has the greatest importance to human life. I shall now explain how they act in terms of the three fundamental elements of fire, water, and soil. The heart absorbs the fire element, the lungs the water element, and the stomach the soil element; the heart corresponds to fire, the lungs to water, and the stomach to soil. But the way in which medical science has explained this matter has been totally inadequate. Science has pointed out the way in which oxygen taken into the lungs purifies the blood, but this alone fails to reach the heart of the matter. I shall now explain the situation according to the medicine that has been divinely revealed to me, but I must first begin with an explanation of the true nature of the spiritual world. It is impossible to understand this true nature without realizing that, though it is imperceptible to the five human senses, the spiritual world is actually the fundamental source of all things. The principle that water causes fire to burn and that fire causes water to flow is the key to the solution of all things. A prerequisite to an understanding of the invisible spiritual realm is an explanation of the realm of air. Oxygen, familiar through modern science, is the spirit of fire; hydrogen is the spirit of water; and nitrogen is the spirit of soil. These three maintain their individual identities but when they are unified they form the essence from which all things rise. The ineffably mystical action of these three elements results in a situation in which extremely hot, extremely cold, and temperate climates are each suited to the needs of the creatures living there. Hypothetically, if all the water element were removed, the world would explode at once. If all the fire element were removed, everything would instantaneously freeze. If all the soil element were eliminated, everything would crumble to nothing. This principle should make clear the basic significance of the function of the heart, lungs, and stomach. In other words, the heart absorbs the fire element from the spiritual world; its operation is the pulse. In a similar way, the lungs absorb the water element; their operation is respiration. The stomach absorbs the soil element from the physical world; its operation is intake of nutrients. The liquefaction of the hardened toxins that cause all illnesses demands heat. This is the first step in the purification process. Interpreted as a pathological symptom, this heat, which is necessary in large quantities, is fever. At such times, in order to accommodate this heat, the pulse rate increases greatly. Since heat concentrates in the affected region, it tends to decrease in other parts of the body, thus bringing about unpleasant chills. At such times, the lungs absorb large quantities of the water element, causing the respiration rate to increase, stimulating the activity of the heart, and preventing dehydration. The spirit of fire is of course, emitted by the sun, the spirit of water by the moon, and the spirit of soil by the earth. Principal among the three major organs is the heart, which activates the lungs, which in turn activate the stomach. Though insufficiency of food in the stomach does not mean immediate danger to life, survival is possible for no more than a few minutes if the lungs become inoperative and for only seconds when the heart fails. This is clear from the custom of medical science of always giving heart failure, not failure of the lungs or stomach, as the cause of death. When a person dies, the heart first stops operating. The body then becomes cold as the spirit, the element of fire which had previously filled it, departs to return to the spiritual world. Then the lungs cease respiration, and the element of water which had permeated the body returns to the realm of air, initiating a process of drying up. Obviously the stomach also stops operating and the impossibility of obtaining drink and food causes the body to become rigid. Since the human body is composed of an amalgam of the three elements of fire, water, and soil, curing illnesses that beset the body is rational only if it relies on the powers of those three elements. This is the principle of Johrei. Johrei depends on power from the Supreme God, a transmitting of light. It is a spiritual light, invisible to the human eye, whereas the visible light of the sun, a lamp, or an electric bulb is the physical manifestation of light. The essence of light is a close union between the elements of water and fire. The greater the amount of the fire element, the stronger the light. However, the power of light composed of fire and water is insufficient. The element of soil is also necessary. Inclusion of the element of soil perfects the union of the three-in-one, which emits a light with wonderful healing powers. Waves of this light penetrate the body and eliminate polluting clouds in the spirit. The effect of this process is transferred to the body in the form of therapeutic effects. As for the practical means of carrying this out, I write, as I have so often explained, the character for the word light on a piece of paper, which is then folded and worn inside the clothing. The spirit of light waves pass through my arm and through the pen to permeate and condense (though I use the word condense, the process is difficult to explain). A connection is then established between the character for light and the source of light within my body by means of spiritual cords along which a supply of light waves passes ceaselessly. The spiritual link between the Supreme God and myself is similar; an infinite amount of light waves is transmitted to me for the sake of the salvation of mankind. As this explanation should have made clear, a therapeutic method making use of the power of the three-in-one composition of the human body is true therapy, and as is only to be expected, such therapy is capable of manifesting unprecedented healing powers. August 6, 1949 062. Absolute Power It is indisputable that the power of God is the source of all activity in the universe. All growth and change are a manifestation of this power, as are the stimulation and cessation of all action. All living creatures, from human beings to bacteria, are born and die because of this power. It is the limitless, absolute controller. I could supply endless other examples of this fact, but suffice it to say that the universe itself is, ultimately, power, which I would now like to examine from various viewpoints. The actual Chinese character signifying "power" ( 力 ) shows how not only the meaning of words but the way they are written is a product of God's will. The character in question is produced by first making a vertical line, then crossing the vertical with a horizontal slightly higher than midway to make something like a cross and finally swinging another vertical down from the horizontal, allowing the brush to rise sharply upward at the bottom of this second vertical in a kind of tail. In short, from a combination of vertical and horizontal arises action, which then proceeds to revolve with a clockwise circular motion. This is the way power itself works. To examine this now in terms of actuality, it represents, in the widest sense, the two great principles or ideologies of the world: spiritualism and materialism, or the spiritualistic and materialistic types of culture. In religious terms, in which they are easiest to understand, these are the cultures of the two great world religions: the oriental vertical spiritual culture of Buddhism and the occidental, horizontal, physical culture of Christianity. In the past, because they have existed independently, the vertical and horizontal have been unable to manifest true power, as is most patently proved by the failure of the world to achieve harmonious unity and to save humanity. The major religions have undeniably had as their goals the realization of an ideal world, but the wretched confusion and deadlock of today's world shows how far the ideal is from actuality, how remote is its realization. Lack of power is the reason for this state of affairs, and that has come about because the vertical and the horizontal have not been bound together. Of course, this may be a matter of time and may be unavoidable within God's plan. If I now explain my own mission, the meaning of what I have just said will become all the more apparent Johrei is the central aspect of my activities. As our members know very well, I write the character of "light" on a piece of paper, which, when worn as a focal point imparts the power to cure completely even those difficult illnesses that doctors have given up as hopeless. I have already written hundreds of thousands of these focal points, but their effectiveness remains unchanged, no matter how their number increases. Furthermore, they are effective, not only in curing illness, but also in altering a person's psychological makeup. They thus improve the personality and save people from very dangerous crises. Thanks to the innumerable examples of such miracles occurring all the time, more and more people are living in happiness. This is due entirely to the power of the focal points; I do not wish to boast but facts are facts and there can be no harm in relating them. Never before in history has anyone ever exercised this absolute power. There can be no doubt about all these miracles, since they are related in testimonials of actual experiences in our periodicals. In Buddhist terms, this power which is born of the binding together of the vertical and the horizontal is the mystical power of the Bodhsattva Avalokiteshvara. In Christian terms, it is the power of the Messiah. Though largely spiritual now, this power will someday manifest itself in physical form. When this occurs a true culture, born of the conjunction of the spiritual culture of the East and the material culture of the West, will come into being. The birth of such a culture is God's goal and God's will and is unprecedented in the world. January 16, 1952 063. One Person at a Time Is Insufficient The great achievements of the many sages, who like Jesus Christ, have worked miracles in saving human beings glow brightly in the history of religion. But such people have only been able to cure individually, which makes it impossible to heal large numbers of people. Even Christ, who performed such wonderful miracles as opening the eyes of the blind, causing the lame to walk, and driving demons out of the spiritually ill, was able to heal only one person at a time, so it is not surprising that his achievements attracted little popular attention in his own day. Yet tens of thousands of our members daily perform similar healing, and there is no telling to what extent their number will increase as time passes. One thing that is predictable however, is that since large numbers of people will gradually be saved, our activities will become an important global issue in the future. Our therapeutic system is undeniably a wonderful medical science, but physical healing alone is insufficient, since the creation of an ideal world is our ultimate goal. We must strive to create both psychological and physical health, producing the kind of human being that is united in spirit and body, thus making possible the formation of a paradise on earth. This discussion indicates that the time has come and that our organization has appeared as the ultimate religion, as is most vividly proved by the way people who accept our faith immediately become capable of miraculous healing powers. (Date uncertain) 064. My Light Some readers no doubt are astonished by the things I have written about Buddhism － things that have been divinely revealed to me, though never said by anyone before. It is merely a matter of timing that has prevented God from making these things clear before. For a long time darkness and ignorance have prevailed, but a great transition into an age of brilliant sunlight, driving away the dark, is approaching. Even in the age of darkness, of course, the light of the moon enabled people to discern things to a certain extent, and they were grateful for such small mercies. I refer to the teaching of Buddhism. Yet moonlight is only about one-sixtieth the power of sunlight, too dim to make things clearly visible. Thus throughout the period of darkness, human beings were deluded, unable to live in peace and tranquility since neither religion nor anything else was clearly discerned. But when it is day, everything on earth is clearly revealed in the light of the sun and nothing is obscure, so that it is perfectly natural that I, whose task is to create a "civilization of day," should understand all things. What, exactly, is my relation to the world of day? Within my body resides a ball of light － what was known from ancient times as the cintamani jewel. I have already made this fact known, but here I shall deal with the light itself in detail. It has been thought that the light is the radiance of the sun, but this is mistaken. It is in fact a close conjunction of the light of the sun and the moon. Its fundamental nature is a union of the two extreme elements of fire (sun) and water (moon). As long as it resides in my body, the soil element of my flesh is added to those two elements, thus completing the three-in-one triad of fire, water, and soil. In saying this, I do not imply that ordinary people are made up entirely of the son element. They too have light, though it is small and weak. My light, however, is much larger than that of ordinary people. It may be tens of thousands or millions of times larger, or so infinitely larger that it defies the imagination. When worn on the person, the three kinds of focal points, bearing the characters for light, divine light and great divine light, immediately manifest healing powers radiated by the light of their written characters. In writing them, I neither pray nor do anything out of the ordinary. I merely write them, one at a time, at a great speed: it takes about seven seconds to write one, and I can easily write five hundred in an hour. Each of those pieces of paper is capable of curing tens of thousands of people. Though I may give them to hundreds of thousands of people, their effectiveness remains unchanged. In other words, the power of the light I possess is inconceivably great. Since I possess such power, it is unlikely that I should fail to understand anything. As our members well know, no matter what I am asked, I am never at a loss for an answer. Sometimes suffering people in places far removed from me telegraph asking for blessings, and many of them receive curative aid from me by doing no more that that. As soon as I hear of their plight, a part of the light within me breaks off and connects with them. The light travels through spiritual cords to bring them assistance. Since this light can be multiplied tens of thousands of times and radiate as far as necessary to make such connections, it is extremely precious. In simpler terms, what radiates from me could be called "light bullets," except that, unlike ordinary bullets, they do not kill but give life. This general explanation deals with only a part of my power; to explain all of it would be difficult. Even so, it will be enough to make people open their eyes and observe the work I do in the future. Any person of intelligence will be able to understand to some extent. In religious terms, people vary in their "spiritual awareness," and if believers purify their bodies and souls wholeheartedly so that they are free of clouds, they will be spiritually enlightened and accurately comprehend my great power. May 25, 1952 065. Who Is the Savior? I consider this an unusual title for an article, as I am sure the reader does. In order to explain it, I must now give a psychological account of myself. I should say in advance that my chief aim here has been to view the workings of my inner mind objectively and without the least deception: I hope the reader will keep this in mind. The words savior and messiah have been used at all periods throughout the East and the West. Yet, with the exception of a few people of special religious faith, the majority of humankind has always regarded the birth into the world of the long-awaited, supernaturally powerful savior as no more than an ideal hope, a great dream. Those who have claimed to be saviors themselves have vanished with the passing of time. Clearly, no true savior has yet appeared. Though I am not fond of calling myself the savior, I must confess that I cannot definitely deny that I am. The appearance of a savior is of unprecedented importance in the history of humankind and, obviously, must not be discussed lightly. Nor can one regard it simply as an ideal: one must believe that it will take place sooner or later, since the sages of the ancient past have prophesied it in such various forms as the coming of the Messiah, the Second Coming of Christ, and the birth into the world of the Bodhisattva Maitreya as the next Buddha. To turn then, to my own psychology: for a long time I have thought that the primary condition for a savior is the ability to solve the problems of human illness. The greatest quality of a savior is to be endowed with an absolute method for perfecting human health and allowing people to live their heaven-appointed life spans, plus the power to put that method into actual practice. Of course, the physical health must be accompanied by mental health. In a famous passage, Jesus of Nazareth made this clear when he asked what it would profit a person to gain the whole world and lose his life. In this connection, I have always held that the value of a religion or a religious leader is clearly limited if the power to eliminate sickness is lacking. One day, over a decade after I first entered the life of faith, I came to understand the fundamental principle of illness and the method for dealing with it. The surprise and joy I felt at that time is unimaginable. Among all the peoples of the world, no one has ever made so great a discovery as this. No other discovery or invention is in any way comparable with it; I must indeed have been born with a miraculous destiny. October 20, 1948 066. Eliminating the Suffering of Illness Since ancient times, two major methods have been used to cure illness. One method is totally spiritual and involves prayers to divine beings or Buddhas, either directly or through the intervention of shamans or other religious practitioners: conjurations, surrogates, or spiritual discipline. The other method, totally physical in nature, relies on such things as medicine, mechanical equipment, surgery, injections, and radiation treatment but includes as well such folk treatments as shiatsu (finger pressure cure) and massage. In other words, the methods are diametrically opposed. In modern civilization, however, science has made such startling progress that it has become usual to assume that physical therapy is the only way to effect cures. Consequently, it is believed that progress in physical therapy will one day free humanity totally from the sufferings of illness. By overemphasizing science, men have come to reject the very existence of the divine spirit. To examine the situation now in greater depth, we see that oriental civilization evolved, according to God's plan of operations, after humanity had developed to a certain stage. For a while it made great strides, but later failed because it was too spiritual and mental, firmly denying physical matter; thus it entered the period of decline in which it still is at present. On the other hand, occidental civilization, which has underestimated the spirit and worshiped the physical developed to the stage it is in at present. But it, too, has ultimately failed. Both civilizations have failed, as the present state of the world clearly proves. In short, humanity has failed first in one direction, then in another. Yet in spite of this double failure, people's eyes have not been opened and they still cling desperately to the kind of civilization that offers no hope. Obviously some kind of great change is required. December 25, 1951 067. Being Midwife to World Civilization This is where Sekai Kyusei Kyo appeared and pointed out the errors in the already faded civilization. In this sense, I am now writing the text for the creation of a new civilization. Essentially this project inclines strongly neither to the vertical nor to the horizontal, but is the teaching of an adaptable, indestructible truth, a truth of moderation. In simpler terms, it recognizes the existence of the spirit while greatly respecting material progress. The Johrei method itself is a combination of the power of both spirit and body, since it consists of the spirit emitted through the palm of the hand. Consequently, I am both the midwife and the leader in the birth of a true world civilization. December 25, 1951 068. Limited and Limitless Power It is necessary to understand the difference between limited and limitless power, since people today tend to assume that all power is finite. Possibly this is all one can expect in a purely materialistic social and cultural environment. Many people ignorant of the truth fail to be successful because they base their actions only in belief in limited power. There are many different kinds of limited power. In primitive civilization the basic power was human power or physical strength. As civilization evolved others followed － mental power, authority, then political power, the power of oppression, military power, financial power, economic power, the power of leaning, horse power, mechanical power, destructive power, the power of thought, the power of the pen, and the power of publicity － these gradually developed to supersede human power. The strength of each one depended on the period in question. In the primitive period, the kinds of power that succeeded each other were violence, authority, and control. It is important to note that all these kinds of power are limited and have no quality of absoluteness, as is irrefutably proved by the way a power once considered absolute can later be totally destroyed. An examination of examples of failures from the distant past makes this clear. In contrast to limited power. limitless power is absolute, eternal, and irresistible. Though limited power is visible and tangible, limitless power seemingly exists nowhere. For this reason, people are unable to believe that it exists and remain convinced that limited power is the only power. Limited power is produced by human beings; limitless power is employed by God. A ready example is the Johrei method used by our organization. People assume that since medical science uses visible, medicinal, and mechanical methods it will necessarily effect a cure; yet find it impossible, at first, to believe that Johrei, which involves no more than raising the hand into space, can have any therapeutic effect. They are totally unable to understand why Johrei, in practice, is comparably more effective than medical science; they can only wonder. In short, they can understand limited power, but limitless power is beyond them. However, for a person who understands the principle, it is perfectly natural. What is quite clear is that medical science is the power of humanity, whereas Johrei is the power of God. (Date uncertain) 069. Philosophical Examination of Johrei The basic premise on which people have criticized the great effect of Johrei is quite erroneous. People have long been accustomed to believing that no cure is possible without physical treatment and tend to think that the effects of our therapy, which employs no medicines and no mechanical devices, must result from psychological suggestion. Nonmembers especially are prone to think this way. Interestingly enough, however, the truth is the opposite. Almost all the sick people who come to us, or who resort to certain kinds of folk medicine, entertain a certain degree of doubt about it because they are baaed by a treatment that employs no machines and no medicines. However, when others explain the great effects it has and when they see how effective it has been in the cases of people close to them, they almost all come to temper their doubt with belief. Most people who undergo medical treatment are dominated by the assumption that they will recover. They all, moreover, put great faith in big hospitals and people with doctorates. Preconceived ideas about the wonders of progress in medical science make their confidence in it incomparably greater than their trust in other forms of healing. This is proved by the way in which many people continue to undergo a prescribed medical treatment in vain for months, without losing their faith in it. Sometimes, even therapy extending over one or two years and resulting only in an aggravation of the condition does not alter the patient's confidence, which is truly amazing in its tenacity. Quite often, doubt does not arise even when mistaken diagnosis and mistaken treatment worsen the patient's condition, when injections cause death or surgical errors increase the gravity of the sickness. When a great doctor, employing all the latest methods, is unable to do anything but go on making matters worse until the patient finally dies, people resign themselves to fate and make no complaint at all; even a great doctor working as hard as possible was unable, they say, to effect a cure. Even when the cause of death being a patently mistaken treatment, a legal suit would be justified, but people usually take the easy way out and let matters ride saying, "No matter what we do now, the person who has died will not come back to life again." Medical science commands this absolute trust, I believe, because, in making judgments, people today are far too likely to emphasize external form, theory, and tradition more than substance. As a young person interested in philosophy I was once deeply impressed by the theories of the famous French philosopher Henri Bergson, especially his ideas on intuitive theory and the perpetual motion of all things. The gist of those theories is as follows: It is difficult for human beings to respond intuitively in making observations of the things around them, since all of us fall under the influence of currently existing ideas. The comprehensive effects of things such as education, custom, and tradition lie latent in our minds, tending to make our thinking fixed and rigid. We are unable to escape their influence. The sum of these things prevents us from grasping objects as they actually are. In other words, they obscure our vision like dark glasses. To understand things correctly, we must put ourselves in a state where not a grain of these preconceived ideas remains to hinder us. Bergson has described the self in such a condition as the self of the instant. It is the self for which there is neither past nor future, the self of the unprejudiced mind, free even of speculation. When the self of the instant views things it is with completely unhindered intuition. This is the only way for human beings to view things correctly. The theory of the perpetual motion of all things － that is, the idea that everything that exists is in constant movement and never stops for an instant － means that the individual self, the Japan and the world of today are not the same as the individual self, the Japan and the world of yesterday. Obviously, the culture, politics, economics, art, and medicine of yesterday differ from their counterparts today. Therefore, what was truth yesterday may, or may not, be destroyed today. If it is destroyed, it was false to start with. Truth that is not destroyed can be said with certainty to be either truth or something closer to truth than falsehood. The appearance of truth in relation to time is also important. There are many historical instances of truths that have been considered supreme for decades and centuries only to be proved paradoxes at a later date. Bergson's philosophy, as outlined here, is extremely convenient in arriving at an understanding of the true nature of Johrei and Western medical science. It is important to note in this connection that the majority of the people who come for our purifying practice do so because the medical science in which so many have absolute faith has failed to cure them. Strangely enough, when the medicine they trust does no good, they are cured by the kind of therapy that they view with suspicion. Reflection on this state of affairs clearly reveals the difference between the healing powers of the two approaches to therapy. It is a sign that the healing powers of Johrei transcend psychological suggestion and go much farther. September 28, 1942 070. Religion and Faith Whenever Johrei is described as a religion or a faith, I insist that it is neither. Religions occur in various forms and require various different kinds of activity, but generally they are organized into sects or groups with certain established doctrines and expounding certain teachings in accordance with which their adherents must act. In addition, religions frequently require their members to worship figures of buddhas, bodhisattvas, gods, sages, Christ, or sect founders. Faith means trust and confidence which grow stronger as time passes and ultimately evolve into reverence and total conviction. Its objects are not limited to gods or buddhas but can include practically anything. Praying for the sun to rise at dawn is faith. The samurai spirit is a kind of faith, as is belief in science. Belief in medical science in the west is also faith that has become so absolute that people are willing to entrust their precious lives to it with tranquility, no matter what effects its treatments produce. It is where these religious elements and concepts of faith are concerned that Johrei differs. It has, of course, no religious element at all. As for faith, it is not entirely non-existent; it is, for example, only natural for people who have recovered from a critical illness, even after physicians have warned of impending death, to rejoice so greatly that their emotion extends into faith. However, this is a natural reaction, and not superstition. Now I have a word to say to doctors. There is a reason why doctors invariably attribute successful cures effected by other than medical means to faith. Their interpretation, based on the experience of western medical science, is that medicines are especially effective when the patient has faith in the doctor administering them. Doctors frequently speak of the many instances in which the same medicine has superlative effect when prescribed by a famous physician and much less effect when given by an unknown doctor. This proves that the medicine itself has no curative effect at all and that belief alone is at work in such cases. In the light of this situation, it is probably unavoidable that doctors accustomed to such attitudes should think that belief in the doctor effects the cure. As I often say, in the case of Johrei the effect for a doubter is exactly the same as the effect for a believer. October 5, 1943 071. Therapy and Concepts There is at present a grave misconception concerning the treatment of sickness. It is the idea － put forward, moreover, by doctors themselves － that healing based on faith and healing by folk medicine are greatly assisted by psychological suggestion and spiritual strength. In my opinion, this is putting things the wrong way round. The average person has absolute faith that medical therapy can cure sickness. The extent of this belief as shown in all kinds of daily instances is quite astounding － as is witnessed by the fact that such people consider any case of cure through nonmedical means to be miraculous. In other words, the patient who chooses to seek a cure through conventional medicine starts with the psychological conviction that his or her sickness will be cured. Should, even so, a cure not be achieved, it means that medicine itself － which theoretically commands all the resources of science and psychological suggestion － has proved ineffective, thus making nonsense of such ideas. Now let us examine the opposite kind of case. In the beginning, all patients who come to us entertain doubts about the likelihood of a cure. Most of them, after having found no help in medical treatment and other methods, are merely accidentally guided to us and turn to our system as a last resort, hoping for a stroke of good luck. Thus, whereas medical science, which theoretically has an absolute advantage in such undertakings, is unable to cure, our group, which ought to be at the greatest disadvantage, shows solid results. There is food for serious thought there. May 15, 1936 072. It Can Be Cured The elimination of illness － that is, the assurance of good health － is the most important of the three conditions we constantly profess as our goal － a world free of illness, poverty, and conflict. Without health, what salvation is possible? Those people of great faith who believe salvation is possible while they groan beneath illness and suffering are greatly mistaken. Though spiritual salvation is possible under such a philosophy, physical salvation is not. The reason why people of faith are only half saved is that, limited to spiritual salvation, the existing religions unfortunately lack the power to save on the physical plane. As a consequence of the long-established conviction that religion should concern itself solely with spiritual salvation, religious scholars have concocted the ingenious theory that physical salvation is heresy. On the basis of this paradoxical view, they voice the highly mistaken opinion that any religion propounding the aim of bringing to its followers actual advantages in the present world is of inferior quality. The members of our organization are able to enjoy in abundance the practical blessings which established religions consider impossible to bestow. Such people who come to us after having been given up as hopeless by doctors immediately take a turn for the better and recover. Such an astonishing truth should be a matter of major concern for physicians. Nonetheless, despite all the critical attacks directed at us by the world, our organization continues to develop at an unabated rate. The people who spread our teaching have no inclination to offer the sick cures from a religious viewpoint. All they do is perform Johrei － purification of the spirit － in response to the request of the person. When the spirit has been purified, the illness vanishes naturally. In other words the process involved is not one of curing but of allowing a cure to effect itself. This is the most important point. It is inconceivable that it could infringe any law or do any harm to society. We welcome any kind of investigation of our activities since the number of lives we have saved and the extent to which we have helped enhance the general welfare are clearly revealed in the mountains of reports and written expressions of gratitude we receive from people who are so happy at being saved by Johrei they cannot contain their delight. Indeed these written expressions of thanks are too numerous to be accommodated in the pages of the monthly magazine Chijo Tengoku (Paradise on Earth) and the weekly Hikari (Light). As a rule, the person who has been helped by Johrei writes his or her own report, telling the facts as they are without exaggeration People who for some reason cannot write their reports dictate them orally. But in all cases, names and addresses are given in detail, and anyone who doubts can visit the people and question them. It is most distressing that people, either wittingly or unwittingly, attempt to hinder us as much as possible in our struggle toward the goal of creating a new Japan. I am at a loss how to describe people who attempt to crush us because we have superior powers in curing illness, humankind's greatest source of suffering, when both the official and private sectors of the population ought to offer us all possible support and encouragement. March 30, 1949 073 . Theory of Method and Theory of Effect Here I would like to deal in some detail with the unfortunate readiness of the general public to misunderstand the Johrei therapy. Although the wonderful effects of Johrei treatment are now known to a large segment of the populace, a considerable number of people, and especially a group of specialists, still seriously misunderstand us. My purpose in writing this is to enlighten them in their error. In the criticisms made of our system there is never a word indicating that its effectiveness is inferior to that of medical treatment. The criticism is that our method is mistaken, unscientific, and superstitious because it makes no use of such material means as machines and medicines. I refute this objection, though I realize that such people make it because they consider human beings to be physical bodies only. In contrast to their opinion, we see the human being as composed of the two elements of physical body and spirit, and insist that the spiritual takes precedence over the physical. In other words, the body moves in accordance with the operations of the spirit, or the will. The difference between our view wd theirs is the difference between materialism and spiritualism or between the belief that the physical takes precedence over the spiritual and the belief that the spiritual takes precedence over the physical. They employ physical means to cure the spirit. The key to determining which of the views is correct is to find a criterion for accurate judgment. The only absolutely infallible criterion is the actual effects of the two methods. In contrast to the materialist method, which deals with visible things that anyone can recognize, the spiritualist method is at a disadvantage in that it is dealing with something invisible and intangible that cannot be readily recognized. When the spiritualists are criticized on this point, no mention is made at all of effects; and method alone comes in for censure. The method that concentrated on visible things seems on the surface to be reasonable. However, without employing medicines and mechanical equipment and relying solely on the operation of the palm of the human hand, we are able to manifest amazing therapeutic effects in dealing with illnesses that medical science cannot cure no matter how much medicine and mechanical equipment it resorts to. In short, one system seems reasonable but fails to cure, while the other seems unreasonable but cures. It is important to note that one system concentrates on method and the other on effect. It should be perfectly clear which of the approaches is correct. To carry the discussion to its logical conclusion, one may say that, even though it is scientific, the system that produces no positive effect is in practice useless and therefore, to say the least of it, not good science. The system that does have a positive effect is useful, and therefore good science. The essential point is that one is concerned with visible things and one with invisible things. The former deals with the visible and is not true science; the latter deals with the invisible and is true science. January 30, 1950 074. Facts Speak Eloquently In a short time, our organization has grown and extended its boundaries to an extent probably unprecedented in the history of religion. Why has this happened? In this hard world, people do not donate money, use their spare time, and remain fervently faithful without some reason. Furthermore, our present membership of two hundred thousand includes representatives of all social levels: from politicians, doctorate holders, university professors, members of the national diet, high ranking officials, and influential businessmen to middle-class merchants, white- and blue-collar workers and farmers. The great diversity of this membership deserves thought. There are quite a number of people who, refusing to accept such facts, self-righteously dismiss our teachings as superstitious and heretical; however, it would be a mistake to condemn such people outright since virtually all of the new religions that have appeared so far have been without true value. Though some of them have flourished in the beginning and have seemed to promise to become great religions in the future, as time has passed they have gradually lost their vigor and ended in fiasco. Only a limited number of them continue to exist today. With examples of this kind in mind, people might be called justified in dismissing new religions as superstition and wrong teachings. How does this situation affect us? Before answering this, I would ask you to abandon all prejudice, begin with a blank page, and look at things through untinted glasses. The quickest and most sensible answer is to talk about the effect of our characteristic Johrei, which is unprecedented in the history of religion and in the history of humanity. That this is neither empty theory nor conceit but living fact is proved most vividly by the mountain of reports on my desk; of the experiences of individual human beings, reporting their overflowing gratitude. The reports are regularly carried in large numbers in the newspaper Hikari and the monthly magazine Chijo Tengoku. Because we know these facts, we are compelled to believe in the possibility of realizing our extraordinary ideal of a Paradise on Earth in which there will be no illness, poverty, or conflict. The work we are doing at present cannot really be called religion. Use of that word summons up associations with older established religions and is therefore a hindrance to understanding the true nature of our organization, which is actually an undertaking of salvation on a scale larger than anything that has gone before it. Since the world is entering a phase of tremendous transformation, it would be difficult without salvation on this vast scale for humankind to escape a great crisis. Consequently God has chosen me as the person to carry out this great undertaking. Though I am not bold enough to call myself a Messiah I can say now that in the future God will manifest Messiah-like powers through me. As history shows, all religions have been misunderstood by the world at one time or another. I am no exception to this rule, for I too have been misunderstood, but the numbers of my supporters are gradually increasing. For my part, I merely act according to God's instructions and, entrusting myself to God, allow time to pass. December 20, 1949 075. Change in the Johrei Method Henceforth, I wish Johrei to be performed in a new way that has been divinely revealed to me and that derives from the recent tremendous alteration in the spiritual world. Formerly, Johrei involved the action of both spirit and body in that, when the spirit was emitted from the palm of the hand, the person exerted a certain degree of physical power. However, the use of physical power had the effect of reducing the spirit's power. Even in the past this was so; that is why, the harder the person performing Johrei tried, the more the effect diminished. To check this tendency, from now on no physical power should be exerted in the channeling, and the spirit alone should be radiated. To explain in greater detail: the light of the divine spirit will pass from me along spiritual cords to the focal points all of you possess, where it will abide. Since that light will pass through the palm of the hand to the pathologically affected part of the recipient, from now on Johrei practitioners must channel the spirit with as light and easy an attitude as possible and must exert no force at all. It is certain that, with this method, healing powers will be much greater － indeed, five times greater this will stimulate astonishing progress in the work of God. You must do as I say without confusion or fear, for it is the will of God, now that the time is ripe and that salvation for humanity is moving forward. I will explain practical details personally in interviews, so as to make them easier to grasp. December 27, 1950 076. Sickness and Human Character My considerable experience has revealed to me interesting correlations between a person's character and the sickness from which the person suffers. As I have discovered in therapy, a person who is direct by nature will recover in a direct fashion. A person who doesn't make a fuss will recover without a fuss. But the illness of a person who is egotistical is likely to persist for a long time. The symptoms of a stubborn person are stubborn themselves. The sick condition of a person who is changeable is likely to alter easily. The sickness of a person with an negative personality is likely to take negative turns. It is important to know the character of the person one is attempting to cure and to alter his or her bad traits, since this is certain to have a good effect on the sickness itself. The best thing is to attempt to develop straightforwardness in the person's character. 1936 077. Pride and Error Two of the things that we are most strongly warned against in the teaching of Omoto Sect are pride and error. It is good that we should be on the lookout against pride, for the experiences of many of our members reveal how it can be a problem. For instance, a person who performs Johrei for the first time is uncertain of his or her ability to heal and goes about the task in fear and trembling. When in fact he succeeds in curing, he or she considers it wonderful; and the person healed is overjoyed and grateful; all of our members must have experienced this at some time or other. But, as time goes by, the person forgets to be grateful for being allowed to heal and comes to think that the greatness resides in himself or herself. When this unmistakable kind of pride develops, stern cautioning is needed, since this is a stage of great danger, one at which the person's thinking can take a reverse turn. As I have already stated, the Johrei practitioner must not attempt to exert any of his or her own human power. The less human power exerted, the better. A proud person, however, is most likely to exert his or her own strength, which has a more debilitating effect on the effectiveness of Johrei than anything else. People often ask me why their healing power has fallen off lately now that they are practiced, whereas it was so much greater when they were hesitant beginners. The explanation I have just given should make the answer obvious. We must also be on our guard against error, for it is easy to make a mistake in relation to one's thinking concerning faith. For instance, people sometimes conceive a desire to know about God's causes and effects, or the origins and relationships of the gods as set forth in myths and legends, or become interested in the phenomena of spiritual possession, thirsting for more and more knowledge on such subjects. Too much enthusiasm on these topics can cause a person to neglect the basics of faith. There is nothing wrong with knowing a little about such matters, but limits must be set, since becoming wrapped up in them can lead the person away from the true path. Error of this kind comes from either not reading my teachings or from reading them but failing to put them to practice. A person who understands what I have written on these two important points and puts my writing to practice will be able to follow the line of true faith. July 4, 1951 078. The True Science of Nutrition The basis of nourishment is the spirit of the food we eat, but contemporary nutrition concerns itself only with vitamins, calorie counting, and other minor details. In fact, the spirit is impossible to understand at the present stage of learning, no matter how much research is expended on the matter, since spirit cannot be measured in a test tube. Calories, vitamins, proteins, carbohydrates, and so on are the dregs left behind when the spirit has been removed. Humans are active beings made up of both spirit and body. Our food, consequently, must nourish both the spirit and the body. Foods themselves also consist of spirit and physical being. The spirit is retained in large amounts in fresh foods such as newly picked vegetables or newly caught fish. Foods spoil when their spirits are allowed to escape. The length of time spirit remains in foods varies according to type: grains retain their spirits longest; vegetables come next; fish lose their spirit faster than all other foods. Observation of the way foods spoil will make this clear. The fresher the food, the greater the concentration of spirit in it. Salt-dried foods retain their spirits relatively long because they borrow the spirit of salt, which removes much of their moisture. The spiritual energy of foods nourishes the human spirit, and their physical components nourish the human body. The fundamental source of human activity is adequate spirit, which is at the same time the factor determining physical strength and weakness. Consequently, it is essential for good health to consume foods with large amounts of spirit. Eating such foods stimulates greater activity of the spiritual being and in this way makes the body stronger and healthier. No matter how many manufactured nutritional supplements are consumed, they have virtually no power to activate the spiritual being and thus have no stimulating effects, their own spiritual elements having been dispersed and weakened. Eating plenty of fresh vegetables is infinitely wiser than resorting to such supplements. Modern science is mistaken in ignoring the importance of the spirit and concentrating research on the body only. Yet, to give a simple example, the limbs and body of a human being do not control the mind; it is the mind that controls the limbs and body. The human body is made up of hundreds of different kinds of matter, principally blood, cells, muscles, bone, hair, fluid, calcium, and so on; each of these is composed of different elements. The organs of the body constantly function without resting a single second. All these things receive energy from spiritual and material elements extracted from foods, which contain without exception all that is necessary for active human life. Consequently, human beings should ideally consume as many kinds of foods as possible. People should eat whatever they want to eat without making the mistake of assigning medicinal virtues to some and harmful effects to others. 1935 079. Foods and Nutrition Specialists in modern health should realize that they lean too far in the direction of scholarly research and separate themselves too far from reality. I say this because, after more than a decade of study, I have come to a conclusion that is diametrically opposed to accepted beliefs. Fifteen or sixteen years ago, I was a great eater of meat. Dinner was always either Western-style or occasionally, Chinese food. In other words, I ate what nutrition experts of the day would probably have considered an ideal diet. But, in my thirties at the time, I never weighed more than a miserable fifty kilograms or 104 pounds, suffered from stomach and intestinal disorders and colds all the time, and never went a month without having to call on the services of a physician. In my eagerness to regain good health, I tried all the currently popular regimens － deep breathing, cold-water massage, meditation, and so on. Though some had limited effects, none led to overall physical improvement. Realizing the negative effects of a meat diet, I switched to eating in the traditional Japanese fashion; that is, plenty of fish and vegetables. Suddenly, I began to gain weight. In two or three years, I was weighing from about fifty-nine to sixty-one kilograms or from 124 to 128 pounds. I gradually became free of colds and forgot all about stomach and intestinal disorders. For the first time I knew the joy of good health; and since then I have remained active and completely strong and sound. Trying the same diet on my six children and the other members of our family, who number fifteen or sixteen in all, has produced excellent results. We know the great happiness of never having our doorstep darkened by the demon of illness. Out of curiosity, I asked my wife and our maid to feed the children on what in the eyes of modern nutrition specialists is poor nourishment par excellence. They were given such plain fare as seventy-percent hulled rice, plenty of vegetables, on rare occasions "inferior" fish such as salted salmon and dried sardines, pickles and rice-and-tea gruel or pickles and salted balls of steamed rice, and homemade rice-and-seaweed rolls. The results were surprising. Our children in both primary and middle school were physically robust. Their nutrition was above average or excellent. None of them, from our oldest daughter, who was sixteen at the time, to our smallest boy, who was four, ever suffered anything that could be called a serious illness, and they always won prizes for perfect school attendance. For the past eight years, I have been applying this experience in treating hundreds of physically ill people, always with excellent results. I would be happy if medical scientists would make a study of the especially good effects vegetables in the diet have had on patients with lung ailments. These are the simple facts. They encourage me to state flatly and unequivocally that, though it seems to have made great progress, the contemporary study of nutrition is fundamentally wrong. This is a matter of great importance to the health and welfare of the whole nation; the time has come to rise up fearlessly, sound the alarm, and issue a warning to the population in general as well as to the learned authorities. If generally adopted, the diet I advocate could have a most beneficial effect on the national economy. I guarantee that Japanese farmers would become incapable of the hard work they have always done if they were to adopt a meat diet instead of the homely fare to which they have long been accustomed. June, 1935 080. Nutrition My detailed explanations in previous articles should already have made the danger of medicines clear, but it is also important not to overlook the great fallacy currently prevalent in connection with nutrition. The science of nutrition concentrates on foods and neglects the way the human body functions. It is folly to try to compensate for nutritional insufficiencies by means of vitamins － which science has actually classified into groups A, B, C, and so on － because this is to overlook the innate capabilities of bodily functions. Essentially the life force is a result of the activity of the bodily functions. These functions, especially digestion, are the main constituent of the drive to live. The drive to live is synonymous with good health. And "activation" of the functions signifies the working of the functions to perfect imperfect foods. This is easy to understand if one thinks of the way the body grows weak when the stomach is empty. The reason for this condition is that food processing has stopped. When one eats, digestive activity resumes; and the body feels refreshed. Since all the body's functions are interrelated, the weakening of the fundamental digestive function weakens all the others. Conversely, recovery of the digestive function brings about recovery of the others. Exercise is essential to good health because it stimulates the metabolism. The good effect it has is supportive and not fundamental in nature. The essential thing is to stimulate the activity of the digestive function itself. And, to this end, especially easily digested foods are not so good. We would do better to eat perfectly ordinary, simple foods. Medical science urges us to eat foods that are easy to digest. However, they are in fact harmful since they weaken the stomach. Though long chewing of food is recommended, it also, if overdone, has a similar weakening effect on the stomach. An illustration of these effects is the malpositioning of the stomach called gastroptosis, a purely manmade sickness, which results from the stomach relaxation that is the inevitable outcome of eating easily digested foods, chewing them too well, and frequently taking digestive medicines, all of which aggravate gastric weakness. In relation to this, I recall an experience of my own. I once tried the regimen known as Fletcherism, which was popular in the United States more than thirty years ago and which advocated chewing food as thoroughly as possible. For a while, the system seemed to be doing me good; but, after about a month I started growing progressively weaker. Realizing that the system was at fault I returned to the ordinary way of eating and soon recovered. As this should indicate, medical science cannot hope to improve health so long as it follows a course diametrically opposed to the truly beneficial one. To take another example, it is very odd to suggest to a mother whose breasts fail to produce enough milk that she should drink cow's milk. Human mothers should be able to produce enough milk to breast-feed the children they bear. If they cannot they have been doing something wrong and the condition will be rectified when they discover and correct their mistake. Medical science is either unaware of or unable to cope with this situation and seems to believe that whatever a mother takes in at the mouth goes straight through to the nipples. This is an absurd error. Drinking cow's milk actually reduces the amount of mother's milk produced. In other words, supplying milk from outside reduces the ability of the mother's body to lactate. A moment's thought will suffice. The process whereby human beings eat rice or bread and green vegetables and yellow beans to produce red blood is wonderful. If blood is produced from eating food that contains no blood at all, then what would be the outcome of drinking blood? Obviously, cessation of blood production. If cows produce splendid milk by eating hay, how much greater is the human power to produce totally different substances from nutrients! Refusal to examine nature is the fundamental cause of the fallacies prevailing in the science of nutrition. Vegetarians are healthy and long-lived because vegetables contain all the nourishment the human body needs in large amounts. Zen priests, who eat simple fare, often live to very ripe old ages. The famous writer George Bernard Shaw, who died at ninety-four, was a well-known vegetarian. In essence, then, human beings should follow the natural course of eating what they want without worrying too much about nutrition. Urbanites should try to eat vegetable and animal foods at a half-and-half ratio. Farmers and the sick should eat seventy to eighty percent vegetable and twenty to thirty percent animal food. With such diets, and abstaining from all medicines, there is no reason why people should become ill. Since so many methods of hygiene and health are mistaken and cause more trouble than they do good, men would do best to live a simple life in accordance with nature. August 15, 1951 081. The Science of Nutrition The contemporary science of nutrition errs fundamentally in studying only one of the two aspects deserving research. It studies only foods and neglects the human bodily functions that must ingest and process those foods. The body's internal functioning, which is still not completely understood even by the scientist with his modern theories, freely produces and alters the necessary nutrients from foods eaten. One has only to observe how magically the digestive functions transform rice, bread, leafy vegetables, yams, beans, and so on into blood, muscle, and bone, even though the most meticulous analysis of these foods is unable to discover the smallest particle of the element of blood or the slightest trace of the basic material of muscle. Nor can analysis find in foods any of the malodorous odor of urine or feces, or any ammonia. Consequently, in prescribing vitamins and other supposed supplements, modern nutrition only increases bodily debilitation. Here is an example to make my meaning easier to understand. Think of a factory that brings in supplies of iron as raw material and coal as fuel. It operates mechanical equipment, utilizing the work of laborers and the burning of coal in various processes that ultimately result in finished products. The production processes are the factory's life power. If instead of raw materials and fuel, however, finished products were brought to the factory, there would be no need for laborers or coal. The machines would not need to operate, and no smoke would come from the chimneys. Since the factory could not continue under such circumstances, the laborers would be discharged, and the mechanical equipment would rust. Similarly, if the human body is supplied with supplemental nutrients in exactly the forms it requires, there is no room for the activities of its own nutrient-producing plant, and debility sets in. This is why it is essential to understand that human energy is generated from the activity of converting imperfect nutrients into perfect nutrients such as vitamins and other similar substances. Moreover, the modern science of nutrition is mistaken in underrating the food value of grains and believing that foods eaten to supplement such staples are more nutritious. The truth is that grains are the major source of nourishment and the supplementary foods of secondary importance － something added merely to make eating the grains more enjoyable. Essentially, the human bodily functions are made to be able to adapt to the environment. The tongue of a person who habitually eats the plainest foods comes in time to find them delicious. This fact, however, is little known; as is often observed in people of luxurious inclinations, gourmets become jaded with ordinary fare and constantly seek new delicacies. Let us now examine the significance of different foods. Fundamentally, foods, which are essential to the maintenance of the life of living organisms, are suited to the needs of those organisms. The Creator thus has determined the kinds of foods human beings, birds, and beasts should eat. It is easy to tell what foods are provided for human beings; foods have tastes, and human beings are endowed with a sense of taste. The human being enjoys eating those foods that are naturally nutritious and that are the elements of which good health is made. It is therefore essential to realize that ingesting such unappetizing things as tonics, which do not require chewing and which do not demand the functioning of the digestive system, is not only mistaken, but also harmful. Each person has a different environment, occupation, and physical constitution. The thing that the individual likes to eat is a necessary element for that person. In other words, we should eat what our natural instincts tell us to eat without being too greatly concerned with such things as theories of nutritional science. Vegetables are more nutritious than anything else. From the nutritional standpoint, a diet of grain and vegetables is sufficient, as actual cases of people who follow it make perfectly clear. Vegetarians like Japanese farmers and Zen priests are healthy and long-lived, whereas urbanites who continually eat fish, fowl, and meat, become sick easily and have shorter life spans. February 5, 1947 082 . The Comedy of Nutrition At present substances such as vitamins A, B, and C, amino acids, glycogen, carbohydrates, rats, proteins and so on figure largely in artificially prepared nutritional supplements and tonics. A great variety of them is available, and the number of different kinds of vitamins increases each year. Though taking such substances, either orally or by injection, may have a temporary effect, it produces no long-term improvement. In fact, they have adverse effects, and the more such supplements a person takes, the weaker the body becomes. It goes without saying, of course, that human beings consume foods for the sake of life support and the manifestation of life powers; yet today's scientific theories misinterpret this truth. In eating, the human being ingests and chews food, which passes to the stomach and thence to the intestines, where the necessary elements are assimilated and the remainder is excreted from the body in urine and feces. By means of this process, the life powers of the liver, gall bladder, kidneys, and pancreas function to produce, extract, and distribute all the nutrient elements needed for the functioning of blood, muscles, bones, skin, hair, teeth, finger and toe nails, and so on. The mysterious, mystical, infinite life process cannot be described in words but is nature itself. The nutrients human beings require for life are contained in all kinds of foods, whose virtually limitless variety arises partly from the need for different kinds of nutrition, partly from differences in individual preferences and capacities from time to time, and partly from the differing needs of the individual constitution. When hungry, the human being eats. When thirsty, he drinks. A person who craves sweets has a sugar deficiency, and one who craves salty food lacks salt. The natural desires of the human being reveal our needs for various kinds of foods. But we all want food that tastes good. It is mistaken to force ourselves to take tasteless or unpleasant things like medicines. The old Japanese saying to the effect that good medicines always taste bitter is equally mistaken. The Creator made things bitter to show that they are poisonous and must not be eaten. Consequently, the better foods taste, the denser their spiritual content and the higher their nutritional value. Fresh fish and vegetables are delicious because they still have dense spiritual beings. As time passes, their flavor diminishes because their spiritual energy disperses. A few words, now, about tonics and artificially prepared nutritional supplements. The body is able to produce freely, in just the right quantities, an the various nutrients － that is, vitamins and everything else － it needs from the foods it consumes. In other words, the body's nutritional function has the miraculous power to produce the vitamins it needs even from foods that are totally lacking in them. Indeed, this process of producing nutrients is precisely what constitutes the human life force: the activity of converting incomplete foods into complete ones is, in short, life itself. Taking artificially prepared nutritional supplements, which are complete foods, reduces the need for the body's own nutrition producing function, which therefore naturally degenerates, thus stimulating degeneration in other functions that share communal responsibility with it and leading gradually to total physical debility. In what follows I give two or three examples of what I mean. Some years ago, the dietary regimen known as "Fletcherism" was popular in the United States. It required that all food be chewed thoroughly till it was dense pulp. I followed this system diligently for a month, only to find to my surprise that my body gradually grew weaker and was incapable of exerting the kind of energy I wanted from it. However, after abandoning the system and returning to my ordinary way of eating, I recovered. This experience shows how mistaken it is to chew food too thoroughly. I realized that, since thorough chewing with the teeth reduces the demand for stomach action, the stomach weakens, and that chewing food moderately is best. Long ago people used to say that a person who eats fast and defecates fast is healthy. In this respect, they were more advanced than modern civilized mankind. Taking digestive aids also weakens the stomach by dulling its activity. The person with a stomach problem again resorts to medicine for the condition, and this further weakens the stomach. In other words, taking digestive medicines is undeniably a cause of gastric sickness. One often hears of cases in which chronic sufferers from stomach and intestinal illnesses made no improvement as long as they persisted in eating easily digested foods but recovered by eating rice-and-tea gruel with pickled vegetables. The way the human life force converts incomplete foods into complete ones can be compared to the operation of a machine factory. Raw materials are brought to the plant, where coal is burned as fuel to operate the necessary equipment. Workers employ the energy from the coal, and the raw materials, to produce, eventually, finished machines. The process whereby this is accomplished is the factory's reason for existing. If finished machines were brought to the factory in place of raw materials, there would be no need for labor, coal would not be burned as fuel, equipment would not operate, workers would be superfluous, and there would be nothing to do but close the plant. April 20, 1950 NATURE FARMING Nature Farming 083. Preface The theory of cultivation without fertilizers* that I have advocated is so unorthodox that it has encountered general astonishment and disbelief － so far, indeed, not only crops but human beings themselves have become addicted to fertilizers. Admittedly, quite a lot of people have accepted the theory － in large measure out of respect for me personally － yet even here they have, as all the reports show, carried it into practice at first only with the greatest misgivings. Then suddenly, just before harvest, when the crop is much bigger than anticipated, the fear vanishes. One fact is more convincing than a thousand theories. I believe that as a result of this great discovery a revolution will occur not only in Japanese agriculture, but someday perhaps, in agriculture all over the world. If such a great philanthropic task were achieved, it would be an unprecedented piece of good tidings for mankind and a perfectly natural outcome of our organization, which has as its goal the creating of a paradise on earth. July 1, 1949 084. Nature Farming To explain nature farming in terms of fundamental theory, I must begin with a discussion of the nature of soil. The Creator made soil for the cultivation of grains and other vegetables essential to the support of life. Consequently, the essence of soil is a mystery far beyond the complete comprehension of modern materialistic science. Over the ages, agriculture has steadily, though imperceptibly, fallen into evil ways. Underestimating the power of soil, farmers have accepted the necessity of using manure or chemical fertilizers for the improvement of crops. As a result the soil has degenerated and altered, and its generative powers have weakened. Unaware of this, and suffering under the delusion that insufficient use of fertilizers causes poor crops, farmers resort to still more fertilization, with the result that the soil declines even further. Farmers all over Japan today unanimously lament the poverty of the soil. I set forth below a few points illustrating how dangerous the use of artificial fertilizers is. 1. One of the greatest agricultural worries today is insect pests. However, instead of finding out what causes them, farmers concentrate all their efforts on exterminating them. In other words, unable to find out the reasons why harmful insects occur, they take what seems to be the next-best alternative. In fact, fertilizers generate harmful insects, and the number of such pests has increased in recent years as the number of fertilizers used has increased. Furthermore, people are unaware that the insecticides used to exterminate pests penetrate the soil and cause it to degenerate, thus leading to the appearance of still more insects. 2. The application of fertilizers gravely weakens crops. Heavily fertilized plants fall and break in wind and rain. They bear little fruit because their blossoms drop. In the case of rice, wheat, and beans, the plants grow too tall and their leaves are too big, so that crops are shaded, husks are thick, and seeds are small and sickly. 3. The ammonium sulfate and ammonia in manure and chemical fertilizers are powerful poisons. Eating plants that have absorbed such substances means that, though perhaps only in minute quantities, these poisons constantly enter the body through the stomach. This can scarcely be called harmless to the health. Doctors have recently reported that cessation for two or three years of the use of manure fertilizers totally eliminates intestinal worms. Here is one of the great advantages of nature farming. 4. Rising fertilizer prices bring the cost of raising rice so close to the price the government sets for it that farmers are compelled to sell on the black market. 5. Acquiring and applying fertilizers and dusting and spraying insecticides require tremendous labor and effort. 6. Vegetables and grains raised by nature farming are better tasting, larger, and faster growing, and crops are bigger than those produced with fertilizers. These points should make clear both the danger of toxic fertilizers and the advantages of nature farming, which can be called without exaggeration a major revolution in Japanese agriculture. In what follows I discuss the results and methods evolved from my own experiences, and the reports of a number of people who have put nature farming to practical application. I suspect that very few people in Japan know what real vegetables taste like because few crops in this country are raised without chemical or manure fertilization. The inherent flavors are lacking in vegetables that have absorbed such fertilizers. Vegetables that have absorbed natural nutrients from the soil, however, develop their own truly delicious flavors. I have found much more happiness in life since I came to appreciate the taste of naturally cultivated vegetables. In fact, the advantages of the nature farming method are so great that to apply it might be called killing seven birds with one stone: the costs and labor of fertilizing are eliminated; there is no unpleasant odor; there is no danger of spreading parasites; insect pests are minimized; crops are large; and vegetables are delicious. To begin with practical matters, I shall first discuss the nature of soil, which is a three-in-one unity of the three great elements of soil, water, and fire. The soil element provides the basic power for plant growth, while the water and fire elements are supplementary powers. The nature of the soil itself, which is the main driving force, can produce either good or bad effects on plants. In cultivation, it is imperative to improve the quality of the soil, which is the fundamental element. The better the soil, the better the results. The way to improve soil is to strengthen its vitality. To do this, the soil quality must be cleansed and purified. Soil that has been purified is rich in power for the raising of plants. Agricultural practices in the past, however, have polluted the soil to an extreme degree. This is best understood by examining the opposite theory first. Fertilizer has from ancient times been considered essential to the raising of crops, but the reality is that the more it is used, the more it kills the soil. Fertilization may produce temporary good effects, but the soil gradually becomes addicted to it and is unable to produce good crops without it. In other words, the more fertilizer is used, the more adverse its effects. When crops from paddy fields become poor, farmers haul in new soil and temporarily increase their harvests. However, they interpret this phenomenon mistakenly. They believe that repeated crops over a number of years have exhausted the nutrients in the soil and made it poor. What they never realize is that the soil has degenerated because of repeated years of chemical and manure fertilization. The new soil they introduce is free of chemical and manure fertilizers and, therefore, rich in life power. For this reason, it increases crops. But I will leave theoretical discussion at this point and proceed to explain the advantages of nature farming in practice. First, I should mention the short height of plants raised the natural way. Fertilized plants grow tall and have heavy foliage with large leaves that shade and retard the growth of such crops as beans. Furthermore, frequent dropping of blooms greatly reduces the formation of fruit. In the case of green soybeans, a naturally cultivated crop will be twice as big as a fertilized one and the beans will be free of insects and have a most delicious flavor. The skins of naturally cultivated string beans and broad beans are incomparably tender. Amateurs trying to raise potatoes often complain that their crops are either small or none and that the individual potatoes themselves are of unsatisfactory size. Unaware that the cause of the trouble is too much fertilizer, and operating under the mistaken notion that they have fertilized insufficiently, they apply increasing amounts of these harmful substances, thus decreasing the results of their labor. When asked for advice, instructors or experienced people totally miss the point by saying that the seed potatoes must have been bad, that the acidity of the soil is at fault, or that planting was done at the wrong time. The amateur has no way of discovering the true cause of his poor crop. Potatoes raised by means of nature farming are extremely white and fragrant, have a firm texture, and are so delicious that they might be mistaken for another kind of vegetable. The same thing is true of taro and yams. Naturally cultivated sweet potatoes raised in high furrows, well spaced in a place that gets plenty of sun are astonishingly big and delicious. I have heard, however, that most farmers use no fertilizers in raising sweet potatoes. The success of nature farming in raising corn deserves special mention. Since all seed, not only that of corn, include the fertilizer poison, crops are not as good as they might be for the first year or two. In the third year, however, there is a remarkable improvement. Corn raised from seeds free of fertilizer poison in land also free of fertilizer poison has very thick stalks and flowing green leaves. If the ground is well watered and gets plenty of sun, the stalks will bear plenty of ears that are long and densely seeded in even rows. Once tasted, this sweet, delicious corn can never be forgotten. Daikon radishes raised the natural way are large, pure-white, thick and sweetly delicious and have a fine, firm texture. It is fertilizer poison that causes the air pockets and hardness marring some daikon radishes. Naturally cultivated vegetables, which are never attacked by bugs, are tender, have attractive colors and stimulate the appetite because of their tempting fragrance. Since no manure is used in growing them, they are of course completely sanitary. Nature farming is especially recommended for the raising of egg plant. Grown this way, egg plants have tender skins, beautiful color and an appetizing fragrance. My own family refuses to eat egg plants that have been raised with fertilizer. In the nature farming of rice, chopped straw, which absorbs heat is mixed with the soil to provide greater warmth. As is generally known, cold mountain water is very bad for rice. Consequently, irrigation ditches should be long and shallow to allow the temperature of the water flowing through them to rise. No ponds should be dug along the course of the ditches since the depth of the water would make it slow to warm up. Nature farming of such things as squashes, melons, water melons, and pumpkins produces unprecedentedly good results. Rice and wheat raised the natural way are short in stature and excellent in both quantity and quality. Ordinary rice is extremely glossy and almost as dense in texture as glutinous rice. It has such body and is so delicious that it is always rated as superior. In brief then, these are some of the advantages of nature farming. surely there has never been better news than this in connection with household vegetables. I and others like me produce top quality vegetables by no more labor than is required to sow seeds and weed the fields from time to time. Although, as I have said, there is no need for artificial or animal fertilizers, it is important to use large quantities of natural compost, which I shall now discuss. In stimulating plant growth it is of the greatest importance to allow the root hairs at the ends of the larger roots to develop. This means preventing the son from compacting and hardening. If natural compost has decomposed too much, it tends to harden easily; about half decomposed is best. Grassy plants are suitable for compost since they decompose quickly. The hard fibers in tree leaves, however, linger for a long time. Consequently, such leaves should be allowed to decompose thoroughly, since contact with the hard fibers impedes the growth of root hairs. Recently some people have argued that it is good to allow roots to come in contact with the air, but this is a mistaken notion. If the soil is loose enough to aerate the roots, the root hairs have plenty of room to grow. This roominess is the reason why plants grow well in such soil. Air has nothing to do with the matter. Warming the soil is another point that must be taken into consideration. In general, for vegetable cultivation, a bed of grassy compost about one foot thick is made at a depth of about one foot. For plants like daikon (turnip), carrots, and burdock, however, where the root is the most desirable part, it is best to mix grassy compost well with the soil and make a bed of leafy compost underground. Recently, people have been concerned about the damage caused by soil acidity. Since the acid is the result of artificial or animal fertilizers, those of us who use the nature farming system have no need to worry about this. Another thing that amazes people about our way of growing vegetables is our success in planting the same crop in the same ground year after year,** a practice that is generally considered unsound. With our method, crops gradually improve as the years pass. This may seem miraculous, yet there is a very good reason for it. The nature farming method takes advantage of, and tries to reinforce, the powers inherent in the soil. Planting the same crop on the same land, year in and year out enables that soil to naturally generate the properties needed for the cultivation of the particular kind of vegetable, to which it becomes accustomed. Though insect pests may not totally vanish when the nature farming method is used, it does reduce them to a fraction of what they are when fertilizers are employed. Farmers often say that too much fertilizer increases the number of insects that plague the crops. I have heard from experts that Manila and Havana tobaccos, which are used in the finest cigars and are famous for their superb aroma, are never troubled with insect pests, because the plants are never fertilized. In particular, there is the fact that insects do not damage weeds; and the special fragrance of the wild parsley and edible chrysanthemum picked in the country in springtime is due to the fact that they have had no fertilizer. It is important to make one point clear. For the first year or two after the shift is made from fertilized agriculture to nature farming, results will be poor. This phenomenon occurs because the soil has become addicted to fertilizers. The situation is like that of the drinker, who, when denied alcohol, suffers a period of absent-mindedness; the smoker who becomes lethargic when he stops smoking; or the morphine or cocaine addict who cannot tolerate being denied drugs. It is imperative to be patient and wait two or three years until the soil and seeds are freed of the fertilizer poison and the land can manifest its great powers. This explanation of the principles behind nature farming should make clear how mistaken the agricultural methods of the past have been. This is a matter unrelated to faith. A person can have no faith and still produce revolutionary results by using natural composts instead of artificial or animal fertilizers. But it is important to realize that, if the divine spirit is used to purify the soil, the effectiveness of nature farming will be even greater. July 1, 1949 *The original Japanese uses a compound term Muhiryo saibai, translated here as "cultivation without fertilizers." However, though the system of agriculture Mokichi Okada advocated employs no commercial fertilizers or animal manure and is popularly called a "no-fertilizer" system, it actually makes extensive use of natural compost. The term "no-fertilizer" is therefore inaccurate. Stressing as it does the powers of nature, this method of cultivation is best described as "natural." Mokichi Okada has stated that this term is proper, and we intend to use it exclusively from now on. ** "Planting the same crop in the same ground year after year." Measures must be taken in connection with the soil and other conditions to make this kind of cultivation successful. 085. The Triumph of Nature Farming The Great Powers of the Soil Principles of Nature Farming The basic principle of nature farming is to give full play to the great powers inherent in the soil itself. Hitherto, people have not known － or perhaps it is better to say have not been told about － the true nature of soil. This gave rise to the idea that fertilizer is essential, and to an almost superstitious reliance on it. In the early stages, no matter how vigorously I advocated nature farming, people either would not listen at all or laughed at me. But gradually my efforts were repaid. In recent years, the number of nature farming farmers is increasing annually, and all of them are reaping astonishingly successful harvests. At present, such farmers are mostly members of our organization. However, judging from the way nonmembers in various regions are coming to see eye to eye with us and the speed with which they are adopting the nature farming method, it is possible to predict that in the relatively near future our method will have spread all over Japan. Publicizing this system is nothing but a movement to destroy superstitious belief in the efficacy of fertilizers. The system is called natural because, rejecting an artificial or animal fertilizers, it employs only natural compost. The leaves and grasses in natural compost grow out of the soil itself. Though provided by nature, chemical fertilizers, animal manure, fish meal, and wood ash neither fall from heaven nor arise from the soil and, since they must be introduced by human hands, run counter to nature when used as fertilizer. Fundamentally all things are blessed by nature; that is, all things are composed of and caused to grow because of the three elements: fire, water, and soil. All agricultural products partake of these three elements, which in scientific terms are the oxygen of fire, the hydrogen of water, and the nitrogen of soil. Reflection on this principle makes clear that God has created things in this way so that the earth will produce grains and many vegetables required for food in just the right amounts, with no scarcity and no superfluity. It is inconceivable that God should allow human beings to be born and then fail to provide the food they must have to live. A nation that is unable to feed its population is doing something contradictory to God's natural laws and will be unable to solve its food problems as long as it remains unaware of the violation it is committing. If my system of nature farming, based on the principle I have just outlined, is put into practice, the food shortages currently causing the Japanese farming population such distress and suffering can easily be eliminated. In his great compassion and love, God, perceiving mankind's error and unwilling to stand by without helping, has caused me to spread knowledge of the principles of this natural agricultural method. The farming population will be saved if only they awaken to their mistake as quickly as possible and adopt the nature farming system. As I have said, the three elements of fire, water, and soil are the energy sources in the growth of agricultural products. There is no doubt that if plants are given plenty of sunlight and water and allowed to grow in clean soil, harvests will be greater than have ever been experienced before. I do not know when it happened, but at some point in history, humanity made an immense and foolish error in using fertilizers, thus revealing its total lack of understanding of the true nature of soil. The Adverse Effects of Fertilizers Fertilizers produce quite good results for a while but they gradually have adverse effects when used over long periods because, forced to rely on these artificial substances, crop plants change so that they become incapable of drawing sustenance from the soil The situation is similar to that of drug addiction. At first a person who takes narcotics experiences a pleasant, mentally lucid state. Gradually, however, he becomes so addicted that without them he lapses into mental vacancy or suffers violent malaise. His overwhelming need may even drive him to steal to obtain the drugs even though aware of the crime he is committing. The frequent cases of this kind appearing in the newspapers reveal how terrible addiction is. The fertilizer addiction which is destroying soil throughout Japan is equally terrible. Farmers have blindly trusted in fertilizers for such a long time that they are unable to open their eyes to the truth. Farmers who have happened to hear our teaching have tried the natural, fertilizer-free method of cultivation but, after being disappointed by the results in the first few months, have frequently leapt to the conclusion that fertilizer is necessary after all and have returned to their old ways. The easy way to understand the true value of our system of farming is to follow my guidance and learn from the result. When people change from the fertilizer method to nature farming, they generally experience the following series of developments. When the seedlings are first transplanted from beds to the paddy fields, for a while the color of their leaves will be poor and their stalks thin. Indeed, by comparison with seedlings in other fields, they will look so scrawny that neighboring farmers will smirk, and the farmer trying the natural method will become worried enough to turn to God in prayer. After two or three months plant condition will improve, and, at blooming time, the farmers' brows will unknit a little. They will finally be put at ease when, just before harvest time, they see that their crops are as good as or better than ordinary. When harvest comes around, they will be astounded to see not only that their crops are big, but also that the grain is of high quality, lustrous, strongly adhesive, and delicious. Most of it will be first or second grade, and practically none will be below third grade. Moreover, the grain will be from five to ten percent heavier than usual and will be so dense that its volume will actually increase instead of reduce in cooking. This means that a person's appetite can be satisfied and will stay satisfied on one-third less than the usual amount of steamed rice. Thus, rice grown the natural way is highly economical. If everyone in Japan ate rice raised according to our nature farming method, consumption would drop by one-third. As long as current amounts continue being produced, this could eliminate the need for importing rice, and therefore have a splendid effect on the national economy. Superstitions about Fertilizers With nature farming, the seedlings are weak and poor in color for the first two or three months because fertilizer toxin remains in both seedlings and the soil. As time passes, however, they rid themselves of these poisons, regain their own innate powers, and gradually improve. Farmers should be able to understand this because they can see how fields that have been in poor condition improve after heavy rains wash out excessive fertilizers. Farmers are in error in believing that hauling in new soil improves crops from low-producing fields because nutrients have been sapped from them by long use. The truth of the matter is that the soil has become poor from many years of being artificially fertilized － so deeply affected are such farmers by a superstitious belief in the efficacy of fertilizers. Merits of Natural Compost In using natural compost for rice cultivation, rice straw should be chopped as fine as possible and thoroughly mixed with the soil to produce a warming effect. To soften soil for dry-field cultivation and thus to permit roots to grow and spread, allow dried leaves and grasses to decompose until soft, then mix this compost with the soil. Recently it has been said that ground should be soft in order that air may penetrate to the roots. It is not that air is good for the roots, but if the soil is soft enough to allow air passages, root growth will not be obstructed. For the cultivation of plants whose roots do not penetrate deeply, mixing grasses and leaves with the field soil is sufficient. For deep-rooted plants, on the other hand, a bed of tree leaves should be made about thirty centimeters below ground level. Such a bed warms the soil. Since root-system depth varies considerably from plant to plant, the depth of the leaf bed must be adjusted to suit the needs of the given plant. The uninitiated claim that composts of this kind contain fertilizing elements is untrue. They are employed to produce three effects; to prevent the soil from hardening, to warm the soil, and to retain moisture around plant roots. Where the soil around crop roots tends to dry, spreading of large amounts of natural compost keeps moisture in. As the discussion so far should have made clear, nature farming takes advantage of the powers of the soil by avoiding the introduction of such impurities artificial fertilizers and by preserving soil purity. Doing this eliminates hindrances and enables soil to make the most of its own essential qualities. Interestingly, farmers err when they think it is necessary to allow soil to rest. Soil improves the more crops are raised on it just as human beings become stronger the more they work and weaker the more they rest. I feel very sorry for farmers who refuse to cultivate the same fields in consecutive years because they believe this will drain it of nutrients. Repeated Cultivation Means Bigger Crops Our natural system advocates repeated consecutive cultivation of the same piece of land. For instance, for the past seven years we have been raising corn on a piece of gravelly land in Gora in Hakone that would take a prize for the most unlikely agricultural site. Nonetheless, the harvest this year is wonderful. The ears are longer than usual and densely packed with even rows of sweet, tender, delicious grains. Consecutive cropping means better harvests because the land naturally develops the qualities suited to the needs of the plants being raised on it, just as men who do heavy labor develop muscular bodies and men who are engaged in intellectual pursuits develop clever minds. Similarly, as human beings who constantly change occupation and domicile are unlikely to succeed, so crop rotation is unlikely to result in abundant harvests. Seeing this makes clear how mistaken are the agricultural practices of the past. Good News for Sericulture Silk worms raised on leaves from mulberry trees cultivated in the natural way suffer from no diseases and produce larger quantities of strong and lustrous threads. The profits that the implementation of this policy would bring to the sericulture world and to the entire national economy are immeasurable. May5, 1953 086. Principles of Nature Farming A complete understanding of these principles is impossible on the basis of established scientific thought and can be attained only through explanation on the basis of the spiritual science that has been revealed to me. consequently, the principles may be difficult to grasp at first. But a person who reads attentively what I have to say and reflects upon it is certain to understand. Anyone who finds it incomprehensible is probably, quite unconsciously, caught up in the superstitions of science. The facts, more than anything else, show that what I say is absolutely true. Actual results invalidate the apparent progress of agriculture today, which, as is well known, is a combination of traditional and scientific methods. Weak seedling stock and the plants' inability to surmount various natural disasters are the direct cause of the poor rice harvests of last year. I am certain that most people would gasp if I told them that fertilizer toxin is responsible for weakening seedling stock. Farmers have considered fertilizers indispensable to crop raising and, owing to their limited knowledge and scientific blindness, have been unable to perceive the harm they do. An important element in their misunderstanding lies in science itself. Science, though admirable in other fields, is not merely powerless as far as agriculture is concerned, it is mistaken. For example, through lack of understanding of the true nature of soil and the capabilities of fertilizers, science has promoted artificial methods and ignored the powers of nature. In spite of the united, long-term efforts of the government, leading farmers, and agricultural specialists, the lack of true progress shows that, in the face of poor crops like those of last year, science is impotent and easily defeated by nature. Japanese agriculture is up against an apparently impenetrable barrier. Happily, God has revealed a natural system of cultivation which will break down that barrier. The cause of present problems in agriculture is the lack of knowledge of the nature of soil and the tendency to stress fertilizers, which are actually only auxiliary substances. What, after au, is the point of plants removed from the soil? After World War II, American soldiers stationed in Japan tried the hydroponic cultivation of plants. Although at first their efforts seemed to produce good results, it has recently been reported that the method is gradually being abandoned. It is astounding that farmers have neglected the soil for such a long time and have concentrated on fertilizers to provide nutrients for the raising of crops. The consequence of this policy is that the soil has become debilitated and acid, as the disastrous crops of last year prove. Nothing can be so foolish as the way farmers have wasted labor and expensive fertilizers to create the very conditions responsible for poor crops. Before examining its nature from the standpoint of spiritual science, it is necessary to explain the significance of soil. The Creator, who made human beings, also made soil in which to grow the food humans require. Seeds sown in the soil germinate and put forth stalks, leaves, flowers, and finally fruit which can be taken in at the happy time of harvest. We should regard the soil, that wonderful technician that produces rice, with gratitude. Since it is the forces of nature that are at work here, there is of course no more suitable subject for scientific study, yet in practice science has made the great miscalculation of relying more on the power of human beings than on the power of nature. Natural power, or X, is generated by the union of sun, moon, and earth; that is, the fire, water, and soil elements. It is common knowledge that at the center of the earth is a mass of fire, which is the energy source of ground heat. The spirit of this ground heat, which penetrates the earth's crust and fills all space up to the stratosphere, is composed of spiritual and material aspects. Its material aspect is what science calls nitrogen; its spiritual aspect is as yet unknown to science. The fire element, which is radiated from the sun, has spiritual and material aspects. The material aspect is light and heat; the spiritual aspect is also as yet unknown. The water element, which is radiated from the moon, has a material aspect － water itself － and a still undiscovered spiritual aspect. X is now the result of the unification of the three undiscovered, spiritual aspects of these elements. Though apparently nonexistent, this X is existence itself. It is the source of life of all things. It follows that, since the growth of agricultural crops is equally its doing, it is, in itself, an unlimited fertilizer. To recognize its power and to cherish and respect the soil is the true, the only agriculture because this allows the soil to manifest its capabilities to an amazing degree. Putting this method into practice is the fundamental solution to the problem. Another important point is the prevailing belief that only animate beings are capable of such reflections of will and thought such as reason and emotion. No doubt the idea that inanimate things are also capable of these things would surprise many people. Yet it is true of inanimate things, including the soil and crops. Respecting and cherishing the soil enables it to manifest its capabilities fully. Keeping soil clean and free from pollution makes it happy and active. The difference between the will and thought of animate and inanimate phenomena has to do with freedom; whereas animals are free and active, soil and rice plants are bound and static. If farmers wish for bumper crops in a spirit of gratitude to soil and rice plants, their attitude will be communicated, and their wish will be answered. It is science's greatest mistake to assume that anything invisible and intangible does not exist. January 27, 1954 087. The Great Agricultural Revolution I Over a decade ago, I discovered that it is possible to produce large agricultural crops by means of the nature farming method, which adds only leaf and grass composts to the soil and uses no artificial fertilizers or animal manure at all. At the time, however, few farmers would lend an ear to what I had to say, no matter how hard I tried to convince them. I have continued unfalteringly to the present not just because from the outset I have known that my belief is absolutely true, but also because I am convinced that the nature farming method is the only way to save the farming population, and is thus deeply connected with the fate of the whole nation. Fortunately or unfortunately, the grave situation that I anticipated with such concern has now come about. I am painfully aware of the need to win the understanding of both the farmers and the general Japanese population. I am gradually perceiving hopeful signs in the outlook for the nature farming method. The fact that I am a religious leader is helpful here because members of our faith believe what I say and put it into practice, even though they cannot explain it. This has produced relatively quick results, and won many sympathizers. Recently, even ordinary farmers who are not members of our faith have gradually started paying attention to our method. Before going into a detailed explanation of the principles where by this agricultural method is able to ensure large crops by adding nothing to the soil but natural compost, I should like to explain its effects. It is startling in the way it reduces costs and labor, there is no need to pay for fertilizers; insect damage is reduced to a fraction of what it is in ordinary cultivation systems, and damage from wind and storm is halved. This means that labor too is cut by half. I have been speaking of rice cultivation, but the method has the same effects with other crops as well. One example of the wonderful success it has with all kinds of vegetables is the immense size of sweet potatoes raised this way. Bean crops too are greater, and individual beans are bigger. Radishes are whiter, finer in texture, crisper, and much more delicious. Other vegetables also have excellent flavor and color, are tender, and are not attacked by insect pests. I have no space to enumerate them all, but an astonishing list of other vegetables － including corn, pumpkins, and watermelons － benefit from this system in the same way. The wonderful flavors of foodstuffs raised by nature farming deserve special mention. No one who has tasted grains or vegetables grown in this way has any desire to eat those raised with fertilizers. I myself eat only foods raised without fertilizers, and farmers following this system have increased to the extent that I receive more vegetables than I can eat. People are grateful to find that abandoning the use of fertilizers can increase the harvests and the quality of fruits. Flowers grown the natural way have larger blossoms and brighter color and last longer in ikebana arrangements. Nature farming drastically reduces insect pests, which emerge because of the use of artificial fertilizers. The folly of the current reliance on chemical insecticides and germicides is greatly to be lamented, since these substances sink into the soil and actually stimulate the development of more insects. Furthermore, plants grown according to the natural system suffer much less than others from the wind and storm damage that has been occurring almost yearly in recent times. Plants are greatly weakened by absorbing artificial fertilizers. I have discovered that chemical fertilizers and animal manure become toxic when absorbed by crops. The resultant poison becomes both nourishment and a stimulus to reproduction on the part of insects. Fertilizers give rise to minute insects which eat the plants themselves. If they develop in the roots, they weaken the plant by ravaging the root hairs. In addition, they can cause leaves to wither, stalks to break, flowers to drop, and fruit to fail to ripen. They cause withering in potatoes. When these minute insects develop in areas other than the roots, healthy plants have the strength to destroy them. But when plants are debilitated because of fertilizers, they fall victim to the pests. In winds and storms too, plants raised the natural way are tough and resilient enough to stand again even when blown down. Plants raised in the ordinary way, however, are ruined if blown down in this way, and an examination of the roots tells why. The root hairs of plants raised the natural way are much more numerous and longer than those of fertilizer-grown plants, and root spread is better. As all farmers know, plants that are low and have short leaves bear more grain or fruit. Nature farming results in plants with short leaves, whereas those raised on fertilizers are tall and have large, long leaves. Though they look good, such plants bear surprisingly little fruit. Since they suffer from no sicknesses, silkworms raised on leaves from naturally grown mulberry trees are extremely healthy and produce more high-quality threads that are both tough and lustrous. In short, all crops raised the natural way are incomparably better than those raised with fertilizers. The important thing to understand in this connection is the capability of the soil itself. Because the Creator made soil to grow the crops needed by humans and animals, it contains in itself more than enough fertilizing material. In short, it is, in itself, fertilizer. Ignorant of this fact, human beings have greatly weakened the soil by applying artificial fertilizers as if they were plant nourishment. This is an astonishing error since, to increase crop production, what is really necessary is to increase the strength of the soil. To ensure the finest results, it is necessary to keep the soil pure by mixing no impurities with it and adding nothing but natural composts. The fundamental theory of nature farming is respect for nature. As the generation and growth of all things in the world illustrate, there is nothing that does not depend on the power of nature: that is, the three basic elements of fire, water, and soil, as manifest in the sun, the moon, and the planet earth. Given plenty of sun, ample water, and pure soil, plants will produce more than human beings require. The leaves that fall in abundance and cover the earth each autumn are the true enrichment of the soil. Nature is teaching us to use them to improve the soil. Cultivators are mistaken, however, if they think natural composts are used as nutrition for the soil. Their true purposes are to absorb moisture and thus to prevent drying, to supply warmth, and to keep the soil from hardening. Thus the best thing to do for rice cultivation is to chop rice straw as fine as possible and mix it with soil in a kneading fashion. Since rice straw is produced by the rice plant, it has a warming effect on the roots. In vegetable cultivation, dried fallen leaves and grasses should be mixed with the soil the usual proximity of wooded areas to fields will encourage their use. The center of the earth is a mass of fire ceaselessly radiating ground heat － that is, the spirit of soil － in the form of nitrogen. A God-provided fertilizer, it penetrates the earth's crust and rises to accumulate at a certain height above the planet. It is then brought back to earth in rainfall to permeate the soil. This natural nitrogen fertilizer descends from the heavens in exactly the required amounts. During World War I, when the Germans were experiencing food shortages and were forced to increase Crop Production rapidly, they discovered that nitrogen could be taken from the air and used as fertilizer. Since then, the practice of using this chemical has spread all over the world. But its temporary good effect cannot last. Ultimately the soil is weakened by oversaturation with nitrogen, and its productive power drops; despite this, people, like drug addicts, have become addicted to the practice and thus overlook the real cause of the trouble. It must be remembered that the amount of fertilizer toxin persisting in soil and seeds even after the change to nature farming has been made greatly influences crops. In wet-field rice cultivation, some farmers may expect a ten-percent increase for the first year, but others may witness a ten- or twenty-percent decrease for the first year or two. The ten- or twenty-percent increase will take place finally in the third year. Very poor crop results after the change mean that a great deal of artificial fertilizer remains. In such cases, it is wise to haul in fresh soil from elsewhere to neutralize its effects. Rice plants absorb such highly poisonous substances as ammonium sulfate when these are used in chemical fertilizers. Consequently, people for whom rice from those plants is a dietary staple take the poison into their bodies three times daily, albeit in infinitesimal amounts. Naturally, this has an insidious harmful effect. It is conceivable that the high rate of illness today is caused by such poison intake. In conclusion, I would like to summarize the economic effects of the nature farming method. 1. The cost of fertilizers is saved. 2. Labor is halved. 3. Crops are greatly increased. 4. Grain volume increases so that there is no loss in cooking, and the grain is delicious. 5. Insect damage is minimized. 6. The danger of ascarids and other parasites, a topic of major concern today, is eliminated entirely. This explanation has shown how revolutionary the nature farming method is. To implement it would immediately solve more than the food problems; by ensuring adequate nutrition, it would also have salutary effects on human health. If implemented throughout the nation, the system would accelerate the rebuilding of Japan, which would without doubt earn the respect of the whole world for the high level of its civilization. It is for these reasons, and to bring this method to the largest possible number of Japanese readers, that I have compiled this special edition. Finally, I should say that I have absolutely no intention of using this material as religious publicity. The results of the nature farming system will be the same for people who do not share our faith. II Last year the season was unfortunately short and no harvest was possible in some areas. However, after considering the reports from various regions, I can understand what happened, and will give my opinion of the situation here. At first, family members and fellow villagers are likely to criticize or ridicule those who adopt the nature farming system, since it rejects the fertilizers that have always been considered the source of crop life. Reading accounts of the perseverance in the face of setbacks of the farmers trying the system brought tears to my eyes and filled my heart with joy at the wonders faith can do. Nor is it surprising that people whose ancestors have for generations adhered to superstitious belief in fertilizers should object to the nature farming method. One recalls how, throughout history, inventions and discoveries, even those that are now making the greatest contributions to humanity, were at first objects of misunderstanding and persecution, and the many records telling how they triumphed over suffering and hardship cannot fail to move us deeply today. I was prepared for the nature farming method to meet with great initial opposition, but felt that the period of patient perseverance would be limited since our system actually produces astonishing results. From reports gathered so far I see that, as predicted, our methods are finally capturing the attention of people in many fields. Nonetheless, external conditions are bad, and, since he is not entirely certain that method will succeed, the farmer who decides to employ it does so fearfully and only as an experiment. Furthermore, since soil and seeds are still permeated with fertilizer toxin, the plants are so yellow and scrawny in the first year that the farmer fears they will dry up entirely and in his anxiety turns to God in prayer. Thus everyone who has tried the system confesses to a feeling of great relief when harvests turn out to be surprisingly good. It is by overcoming the initial period of hardship that the crown of victory is won. May 5, 1953 088. Insect Pests The three greatest burdens on the agricultural community in recent times have been the high cost of fertilizers, insect pests, and damage from wind and storm. I have already dealt adequately with the topic of fertilizer, and would now like to speak in detail about insect pests. Harmful insects breed because of fertilizers, which pollute the soil, cause it to degenerate, and weaken its potential. At the same time, the impurities introduced by the fertilizers remain. All kinds of matter decomposing in the polluted places encourage insects and bacteria. The several varieties of fertilizers are responsible for the varieties of insects that breed because of their presence, and the new kinds of insect pests that have emerged recently are the results of the production of new kinds of fertilizers. One should emphasize here the grave wrong committed by people who use chemical insecticides to rid themselves of crop pests. These substances, which are toxic enough to kill insects, permeate and ruin the soil. Soil polluted with chemical insecticides adds yet another poison to the fertilizer toxin already absorbed by plants grown in it. The soil weakens and, like human beings, loses its powers of resistance, with the result that insect pests proliferate. This kind of vicious circle is a good example of how mistaken agricultural practices have been in the past. Obviously, the health of people who eat rice raised with the highly toxic fertilizer, ammonium sulfate, will be adversely affected, since their blood will be clouded. Even though individual dosages are very small, eating such contaminated rice three times daily all year round causes a large accumulation of toxin, which becomes the fundamental cause of all kinds of illnesses. January 15, 1951 089. Damage from Typhoons and Floods Both the governmental and the private sectors are anxious to do something to prevent the ever-increasing crop damage caused by typhoons and floods. Proper preventive measures would require enormous expenditure, and for the moment one has to be content with stopgaps. Nevertheless, so long as great losses are incurred each year, action of some kind must be taken. Those who accept that to minimize the damage is the most that can be expected at the present time are amazed at the way plants raised according to our nature farming method withstand wind and storm. Their root spread, for instance, is good, and stalk breakage is only a fraction of what it is with fertilizer grown crops. Flowers do not drop, and rice does not rot even after rain. Indeed, in comparison with fields of rice raised with fertilizers, fields cultivated the natural way seem to suffer no storm damage at all. Examination shows that plants raised without fertilizers have many more hair roots and much stronger root spreads than plants raised with fertilizers, and are consequently as strong and healthy as human beings fed on a plentiful diet of wholesome, toxin-free foods. Farmers always welcome plants － not just grains, but all other crop plants as well － that are low and have small foliage, since they bear better. This accords exactly with the results of my own method, and serves to show how superior it is. People of experience are unanimous, moreover, in praising the excellent quality and flavor of the crops. Crops of plants raised with fertilizers, on the other hand, are less satisfactory because too much nourishment goes to their leaves, which flourish to the detriment of the fruit or grain. Offshoots from rice raised the natural way are extremely numerous. The record at present is an amazing one hundred and fifty shoots, producing fifteen thousand grains, from one rice seed. Furthermore, naturally cultivated rice straw is of very high quality and is strong enough to be used in many ways. January 15, 1951 090. Raising Tangerines for Forty Years Through Nature Farming Not long ago, a member of our organization gave me tangerines from a tree he has been cultivating for forty years without the use of fertilizers. I ate some at once and can say I have never found anything so delicious. Fellow believers often give me naturally cultivated fruits and vegetables that, though certainly more delicious than those raised with fertilizers, are still not one-hundred percent as good as they should be. This is because some fertilizer toxin remains in their seeds or in the soil in which they are grown. It takes more than four or five years to eradicate this toxin and allow true flavors to emerge. Eating the tangerines made me think of the effects our cultivation method could have on the economy. If naturally grown fruits and vegetables were marketed, their delicious flavors would soon win them an enormous following, and there is no telling how great sales might be. In addition, they could be exported abroad, bringing in unprecedented amounts of money, to the great advantage of the national economy. Recently, many stores have started selling so-called sanitary vegetables raised with chemical fertilizers but without human manure. It is true that this system eliminates the danger of internal parasites, but the vegetables themselves are inferior in flavor. Consequently, experienced members of our organization could make plenty of money selling vegetables and fruits raised our way, without fertilizers of any kind. Aside from making money, such action would publicize nature farming, and I would like our members to start doing this at once. December 5, 1951 091. Home Vegetable Gardens So far, I have directed my explanations largely at people who farm for a living, but I would like to conclude with some words on the domestic garden. With nature farming, the method is clean and sanitary, and crops are surprisingly good, abundant, and flavorful. There is no need to worry about damage from insects and there is no danger of internal parasites. Leaf color and stalk form are much better than in plants raised with fertilizers. A home gardener who adopts the nature farming method finds his daily garden chores enjoyable rather than trying as in the past. Amateur gardeners have often complained that their potatoes did not produce well or that the potatoes were small. They have spoken of flowers dropping from tomatoes and eggplants or of daikon (turnips) riddled with holes. Other constant complaints include cucumbers that wither because of root worms, or pickling greens with practically no undamaged leaves. The home gardener, unaware that these crop failings have been caused by use of fertilizers, has assumed that he has been fertilizing too little and has increased the amounts, thereby further damaging his produce. Puzzled, he has turned to the specialist for help. The specialist has been unable to give a satisfactory answer, for he too is superstitiously convinced of the importance of fertilizers, and the number of people troubled and perplexed by the situation has increased greatly. If all these people only knew of the nature farming system, they would experience a quite extraordinary sense of relief. January 15, 1951 092. The Great Agricultural Revolution Clean and Enjoyable Home Gardens I would now like to explain the system mainly for the benefit of the home gardener. Readers of Chijo Tengoku and of this paper will already be aware of the wonderful results farmers achieve by growing crops without fertilizers. The same system can be a light in the darkness for the home gardener as well. In addition, it provides the double advantage of crops better than those possible with fertilizer, and of reduced labor. For reference, I will enumerate here the most important of the many benefits of the system. 1. Since only natural leaf and grass composts are required, there is no need to deal with animal manure. Labor is reduced. 2. All vegetables are of better quality and much more delicious than those raised with fertilizers. 3. Individual fruits and vegetables are larger and crop quantities are greater. 4. Insect damage is reduced to a fraction of that experienced with fertilizers, and there is obviously no need for insecticides. 5. Plants raised without human manure cannot carry ascarids or other internal parasites. Since most home gardeners raise vegetables rather than grains on their limited plots of land, I shall now discuss some of the experiments we have already completed on vegetable cultivation. Amateur gardeners often complain that their potatoes bear poorly and are small. These difficulties, which are caused by fertilizers, do not exist in nature farming, which makes it possible to produce large crops of pure-white, dense, subtly flavored, and appetizing potatoes. Corn stalks are thick and the leaves are long and bright green. It is possible to ten at a glance that they are larger than usual ones. The ears are long and thick, and heavy with densely packed, orderly rows of tender, sweet kernels. Daikon (turnips) are longer and thicker than usual. They have a fine, crisp texture, are extremely delicious, and completely lack the holes and hard places so often caused by fertilizers. All the leafy plants used in Japan for pickles, spinach, Kyona (Japanese cabbage), Chinese cabbage, and cabbage turn out subtly flavored, tender, large, and appetizing. Last year, an amateur gardener showed me three heads of Chinese cabbage he had raised, each weighing roughly six kilograms. They were the largest I have ever seen. All bean crops are better with nature farming, but green soybeans are especially noteworthy. The plants have short branches and small leaves and produce twice as many beans as plants raised with fertilizers. Each pod usually contains four beans; almost none contains only one. Tempting to see and delicious to eat, eggplants have good color, tender skins, and strong flavor. Anyone who has eaten them raised the natural way will never want eggplants produced with fertilizers again. I shall not discuss them in detail here, but scallions, onions, tomatoes, pumpkins, and all the melons are also outstanding when cultivated without fertilizers. The smooth texture and delicious taste of pumpkins grown this way, however, deserve special mention. Yams raised according to the nature farming system are exceptionally large, and grow even larger if they are allowed to remain in the ground somewhat longer than usual. Fruits raised the natural way, especially citrus fruits, persimmons, and peaches, are much more delicious than those raised with fertilizers. Natural composts, which are essential in nature farming, are of two kinds: grass and tree leaves. Grass is suitable for mixing with the soil; leaves are used to make bedlike layers under the soil. I shall now explain the effects and principle of cultivation without fertilizers and the difference between it and ordinary methods. Originally, the Creator made soil for raising vegetable foods; as such it is a subtle substance of mystic properties. Taking full advantage of its powers is in keeping with soil's essential function. Not realizing this, however, at some period in the past people made the mistaken decision to employ fertilizers, which killed the soil by destroying its vitality. Attempting to rectify the situation by using still more fertilizers, they caused plants to become addicted to these outside substances. The soil of Japan is now said to be poor. This is because of the use of fertilizers, and the chemical fertilizers that have recently come into use have aggravated matters. To prove this, one has only to examine the case of rice cultivation. When rice crops decrease, farmers attempt to stimulate better growth by hauling into their paddy fields soil from other areas. They do this in the belief that importation of virgin soil will restore the nutrients that long periods of cultivation have depleted. They are totally mistaken; the truth is that long application of artificial fertilizers and animal manure has destroyed the soil's vitality. The importation of soil free of fertilizer toxin restores it. The purpose of composts is to keep the soil soft and warm. Roots must be able to spread well if plants are to grow strong and vigorous, so the soil must not be allowed to become packed hard. Thoroughly mixing grassy composts with the soil prevents such hardening. Grassy composts, which have tender fibers, permit the growth of root hairs at the ends of plant roots. Tree leaves, on the other hand, have tough fibers and should not be mixed with the soil. Instead, they should be used to form bed layers for keeping the soil warm. Ideally there should be a layer about 30 cm thick of soil mixed with grassy compost and below it a layer of tree leaves about 30 cm thick. This arrangement is good for all vegetables and beans. For crops of long-root vegetables like daikon (turnips), carrots, or burdock, adjustments in layer thicknesses must be made. Furrows of maximum height provide the roots with ample sunlight and growth is excellent. Yams planted at intervals of about 30 cm in furrows about 60 cm tall reach astonishing sizes. Furrow orientation － east and west or north and south － must be determined on the basis of natural lighting and prevailing wind directions. To prevent strong winds from breaking stalks and scattering the ridges of earth, it is always wise to build suitable fences or plant trees as windbreaks. March 30, 1949 093. The Earth Breathes All things － not just animals but plants and minerals as well － breathe. In fact, the planet earth itself breathes, as I shall now explain. Earth breathes once a year. Exhalation begins in the spring and reaches its climax in the summer. The exhaled breath of the earth, like that of human beings, is warm. It results from the emanation of ground heat and grows more intense in spring, when all things begin to grow. The grasses and trees come into bud first of all, all things reach upward, and man himself feels a lifting of the heart. As summer approaches, the vegetation flourishes increasingly till a kind of peak is reached, when the earth itself begins to breathe in. At this point, plants and trees wither, and all things go into a state of decline. Human beings too become cool and calm. As this course of development moves toward the opposite pole, winter sets in. In this natural cycle, the earth exhales its spiritual ether － nitrogen, in scientific terms － which enables plants to grow. Nitrogen constantly rises, collects at the upper limits of air, then is returned to earth again with the falling rain. This is natural nitrogen fertilization. It is an error to take nitrogen from the air and use it artificially as fertilizer. At first, this increases crops, but if nitrogen fertilization is continued for a long time, the soil becomes poor as a result of nitrogen addiction. In other words, oversaturation of nitrogen dulls the soil's vigor. During World War I, the Germans invented nitrogen fertilizer in order to increase crops. They were able to achieve their wartime aims with its use, but such fertilization should have been abandoned with the return of peace. Incidentally, sun spots, for which there have long been various explanations, represent in fact the breathing of the sun. Every eleven years, when the spots are said to increase, the sun reaches the end of its exhalation phase. Though it is usually said that the light of the moon is a reflection of the light of the sun, the burning of the sun might also be seen as caused by the moon's water element. The waxing and waning of the moon, which take twenty-eight days to complete, represent that body's respiratory activity. September 5, 1948 CONCLUSION 094. Conclusion In this book, besides providing a solution to the problem of health, the fundamental source of human happiness, and discussing the possibility of creating a world without illness, I have dealt with ways to eliminate poverty and strife. I also explain that the spiritual world, being the source of all things, is where true solutions to all problems must be worked out. By avoiding theory and concentrating on actual experience and examples, I think I have enabled the reader to understand the basic concepts of my philosophy and to find a certain amount of hope and tranquility. As the book makes clear, my true purpose is to save as many of the world's two billion people as possible at a time when the unprecedented shift from the old world of night to the new world of day threatens massive destruction. I feel sure that my readers will give their wholehearted assent to this aim. In addition, while suggesting a revolution in the field of medical science, I have attempted a blueprint for the realization of a heaven on earth in the new world to come. My ideas must be put into practice in a realm that is not exclusively scientific nor religious but a combination of both and that also relates to politics, economics, education, morality, and art. I foresee the imminent birth of a new culture in which all the useless elements from the culture of night will be destroyed while all that is still useful will be preserved. The recent idea of a world federation is a manifestation of the new world I have in mind. In that world, my new ideas for cultural activities in religion, politics, economics, education, and art will at last be made known. Like our medicine, they will be something mankind has never known before. For the creation of a heaven on earth, an unprecedented undertaking, unprecedented concepts must be established. Christ urged his followers to repent because the kingdom of heaven was at hand. The Buddha said that, after his own death, the world of the Bodhisattva Maitreya would come into being. At present, the entire planet is experiencing the birth pangs of a new world. February 5, 1947 APPENDIX 095 Address by the Founder of the Sekai Kyusei Kyo Delivered at the Hibiya Public Hall, Tokyo What I am about to say is very unusual and unlike the things other people say. But what would be the sense in my coming all the way here from Atami just to say the same things as others? People are fond of calling our time an age of culture － an age in which culture has made great advances. Such remarks represent a confusion of culture and civilization. The two are very different. A civilized world is an ideal one completely free from barbarity. Culture is the stage between barbarity and the attainment of civilization. Men today are infatuated with the chimera "culture," convinced that what they have now is either fine in itself or can result in a good world if further improved and developed. Actually, however, the world today is very different from what I mean by a civilized world. In the simplest terms, civilization is a state in which life is safe, in which the safety of human life is ensured. However, the world today is perilous and frightening, threatening a last judgment in the form of atomic and bacteriological bombs or the like. Ours is a time of culture, not civilization, since the safety of life is threatened. We live in an age of transition between barbarity and civilization. What, then, is civilization? War and illness are the greatest threats to life. Consequently, a truly civilized world is one totally free of these two threats; one in which the safety of life is completely guaranteed. Since it is now imperative to move toward that civilization, the Sekai Kyusei Kyo has adopted as its goal the creation of a world free of illness, poverty, and conflict － war being, simply, conflict on a grand scale. Illness, which is the source of all three of these evils is both physical － something that hurts or caused discomfort － and mental. Without curing such physical illnesses as tuberculosis, contagious diseases, and dysentery － which are said to be unusually common this year － it will be impossible to achieve a civilized world, even in hundreds or thousands of years. As personal histories show, the roots of poverty lie in physical sickness. A person loses or is unable to find employment because of bodily illness and is therefore forced to bear the double hardship of physical suffering and loss of income. This in turn has a negative effect on family, relatives, and friends. Psychological illness is the cause of war. The people who initiate hostilities － history calls them great men and heroes － possess great power and brains but suffer from a kind of psychological sickness. In short, we must eliminate both mental and physical sickness for the sake of creating a true civilization. In theory at any rate, it is assumed that medical science can cure physical illness － members of the medical profession are doing their best in that direction － and that only religion can cure psychological illness. Doubt persists however, about the very possibility of cures. In fact, only Johrei can heal the mind and the body and thereby enable us to create a civilized world. Seeing humanity and the whole world today as barbarous in the worst sense, I fear modern warfare much more than I would have feared fighting in some so-called "barbaric" age. People today are dazzled by the cultured － or "civilized," as they say － surface of a society that is barbarian － at best semicivilized － in its essential nature. It is as if they were admiring the beauty of a woman who is wearing fine clothing but who is actually a mass of syphilis and suppuration. Sekai Kyusei Kyo is not a religion. If religion were capable of solving our problems, solutions would have been found long ago. Throughout history, religious leaders, founders of faiths, philosophers, and moralists have purported to solve issues, make progress, and put things right. Humanity has reacted toward them with the same unquestioning trust shown by a tattooed, naked savage to a witch doctor. But the failure of all the religionists' efforts to ensure the safety of life points to their lack of power. They have been able to bring the barbarians to a state of culture but are impotent to take them further to a state of civilization. Mankind has made many wonderful discoveries and has invented many splendid things but has used them in wrong ways. The discovery of atomic energy is an illustration of my meaning. Used correctly this discovery would make it possible to operate a train or automobile for days on an energy source no larger than the tip of a finger. Instead of putting it to such good uses, however, human beings created the atomic bomb, which as we know, is capable of killing millions of people. The airplane, a fast and convenient means of transportation has been converted into a dreadful machine carrying deadly bombs. Although science has advanced so far, yet lacking the essential quality, it has been put to wrong uses that cause humanity suffering and hardship. If only the soul is altered, however, these things can be put to good uses and employed in the creation of a splendid world. Christ urged people to repent because the kingdom of heaven was at hand. Shakyamuni predicted that, after his death, the realm of the Bodhisattva Maitreya would come into being. As I see things, it would have been better if Christ, for example, had talked less of the kingdom of heaven's being at hand and more about creating a kingdom of heaven; but in practice the world at that stage was not ready for such things. In those days, culture had not advanced to the stage where the creation of true civilization was possible. What they said was therefore right for their time. By now, however, material culture has advanced so much that the world has become almost completely one. What I am saying can be heard in all corners of the globe. I could board an airplane and after a single night's sleep, be in America. The physical conditions for the creation of a civilized world are nearly fulfilled, but our souls still have not developed to the point where we are ready to put our knowledge and skills to good uses. We must ten all men of this situation and help them develop the right kind of soul. As the members of our organization know well, I am constantly writing with the aim of telling people these truths. In addition to carrying this message to others, I am engaged in Johrei, which is a method of curing illness and of healing the evil － in simpler terms, barbarity － in the soul. The soul itself cannot be removed, since human beings cannot live without souls. Johrei, therefore, alters its way of thinking by dissolving evil elements and increasing the number of good elements. All people who have undergone this experience feel a desire － a compulsion － to do good. As I often ten members of our organization, people today frequently want to do wrong. Even when they do not have this positive longing, they feel that doing good is foolish and that to be open and frank somehow lowers their dignity; thus, they prefer to put up a good front and look smart. In fact, their attitude is the reverse of the correct one, though many years ago even I myself did not realize this. I too thought it was clever to get ahead in the world by doing flashy things. As I came to know God through faith, I saw I was wrong. From then on, I found myself concentrating on looking for something, anything, that would be good for others. By "good" here, I mean anything that makes people happy, makes them feel good, pleases them, gives them satisfaction. From that point on, things began to go better for me. In short, when one begins to look at things in this way － it's not a matter of faith at this stage － one discovers that things are going increasingly well and that one is finding increasing happiness. So I felt a sudden desire to let other people know about it. The more I experienced this practical truth, the more I came to realize that God and the devil really exist, and from that time on I was subjected, little by little, to all kinds of what I might call training in faith. And all kinds of miracles and the like convinced me quite plainly that I had an extremely important mission to fulfill. And that is how I came to form the Sekai Kyusei Kyo and to start the activities in which I am still engaged. Many sages and men of religion have dealt with the topic of a final judgment for humanity － Jesus Christ spoke of the last judgment and the Buddha mentioned a world that would come into being after his own death. It is often thought that this final judgment will be a kind of court session, not in hell but in the actual world, presided over by someone like the Buddhist Yama, king of the spiritual world. This is not true. The spiritual realm, to put it simply, consists of three realms for all beings: the physical, tangible, visible world of ordinary experience; the inner spiritual realm; and the realm of air, which is intermediate to the other two. In general, humanity understands the physical realm and the realm of air but not the spiritual realm. In other words, there are three stages comparable to the three stages of human history from the barbaric age, to the age of culture, and then to the age of civilization. In addition, the world undergoes alternating phases of light and darkness. The most common of these is the twenty-four-hour cycle of day and night. In the yearly cycle, winter, when the rays of the sun are the weakest, is the period of dark, and summer, when those rays are strongest, the period of light. Moreover there are ten-year and one-hundred-year periods of light and dark manifested as ages of peace followed by dark ages. This too is a kind of rhythm. There are similar alternating stages lasting a thousand years and ten thousand years. We have long been in an age of dark but are now about to enter an age of light, of civilization (the second of the two characters used to write the Japanese word for civilization, "bummei," means "bright"). When the transition from dark to light is made, things of darkness that have no place in the culture of light must be gotten rid of. There will be many of them, like the electric light that is useless in the daytime; they will have to be destroyed. The "Last Judgment" means differentiating between what will be useful and what will be useless when the break between day and night occurs, useless things must be either put away or destroyed, and new, useful things must be created. Human beings themselves also consist of a physical being, a spiritual being, and an intermediate water or water-vapor being corresponding to the realm of air. The human body contains a large amount of liquid. The spiritual being, or soul, belongs to the spiritual realm. As the spiritual world becomes light, the spiritual beings of humans must become correspondingly light. This means that whatever cloudiness is in them must be removed; this must be accomplished by means of a natural process of purification replacing the unclean with the clean But the cleansing process will involve suffering since, as our faith teaches, purification is the principle source of illness. In the past, people have not known or have ignored the strength of the operation of the spirit － the soul. For example, the day before yesterday, I happened to think of a person I had not seen for a year. Then, yesterday, he came to see me. Such communication takes place along what are called spiritual cords, whose operations are most interestingly observed in affairs of the heart It is not my purpose to discuss such things here, but it does seem that when one comes to believe, one begins to understand this kind of communication, which helps one to understand better the nature of, and the prospects, for a love affair among other things. This is no light matter. Foreseeing all kinds of development in society by means of the spirit and spiritual cords can prevent tragedy and social evil But enough of such matters for the moment.... Where moderate sickness is enough to remove cloudiness and make the spirit conform to the environment of light all is well. But if the cloudiness is very great the illness required to eliminate it may be so grave that the person dies. Illnesses that come in small doses may be tolerated, but when all the sickness required for purification comes at once, the burden may be too crushing. The final judgment when the spiritual realm becomes totally bright, will suddenly inflict this kind of intolerable burden on many people. God in his mercy is taking pity on them at present and trying to help them by letting them know what is imminent. Thus he commanded me to make these things known. Whereas Christ and Shakyamuni prophesied the coming of a better world, I proclaim now the need for us to make it ourselves and to create on earth a heaven free of illness, poverty, and conflict. God has commanded me that we should make it. In fact God has already done all the preparations. I do not need to work myself to death in actual acts of creation: all I need to do is to deal with phenomena as they present themselves. This is easy, yet imposes on me a responsibility greater than anything humanity has ever known before. Carrying it out will make the prophecies of the great men of the past cone true. If they failed to come true, the prophets who made them would be liars, and great men like Christ and the Buddha were not liars. Therefore, someone must make their prophecies come true, and I have been selected for the task. Until now, I have never spoken of this immense and awesome responsibility; but today, for the first time in front of a large assembly, I make this statement because the time of change from night to day is gradually approaching and I must inform the greatest number of people as quickly as I can for the sake of their own salvation.

――― 関 連 出 版 物 ――― 中島一斉先生 ――その信仰と生涯―― 麻生 鋭 四十五 「気の利く人間になれ」 先生は、よくこう言った。 昭和二十三年。戦争が終って三年になっていたが、まだ国内の治安も十分でなく、人々は信ずるより疑う方が得だという気持で、荒れた毎日を過していた。 気の利く人間とは、要するにずるい人間のことだと思い、あまりこの言葉の値打もないような時世だった。 しかし、集る信者たちに、先生はいつもこの言葉を繰り返した。 ある時、遠い地方からの信者が集る日なのに、夜来の雨がその朝になってもやまず、びしょびしょと降り続いている。――そういう日であった。 やがて、時刻が来て、熱海駅から大勢の信者が濡れ鼠になって入って来た。 遠い地方から来た人たちなので、誰も雨具の用意はしていなかった。ずぶ濡れの信者たちを見ても、受付の人は、気の毒にとは思いつつも、駅に傘を持って迎えに行かなかったことを別に不親切だったとも考えなかった。 あとで、助手たちに、先生は言った。 「皆、遠いところから、夜通し汽車に揺られて来るのは、なんのためか。お光をいただいて、少しでも向上し、世界人類を可能な限り救おうとされる神の意志に添って、地上天国の建設のための一役をしたいという念願に燃えているからではないか。又、君たちは、その人々の誠のしるしとして持って来たものを、それぞれ頂いているではないか。それなのに、君たちは、濡れて来た信者を見て気の毒だと思うだけで、誰も駅まで傘を持って行かなかった。いや、傘を持って行くべきだと考えた者もいなかったのだろう。よくよく反省しなければいけない。私がいつもいう気の利く人間とは、親切な人間ということだ。不親切だが気が利く人間なんていうものには、私は用はない」 先生の審判は、きびしいものであった。 と言って先生は、あまり気の利き過ぎる人間は嫌いであった。 「気の利かないやつと、気の利き過ぎるやつ。おれは、どっちも嫌いだ」と言っていた。 この言葉は、信者の中でも、よくその意味がわからない者が多かったようである。 しかし、先生の言わんとするところは、気が利き過ぎるということは、親切ということの反対の場合が多いということであったろう。 先生は、こう言った。 「気が利くということと、感謝の気持とは、一つなのだ。感謝の気持がなく、ただ気を利かそうと思って気を利かせる――これは本物ではない」 先生は、下座の行ということを、いつもくどい程言っていた、 「人間失敗の原因の一つは、威張るということだ。本当の成功者は、決して昔を忘れない。昔を忘れて、矯〔驕〕りたかぶることは、失敗の第一歩である。神の前に、人間の地位、身分の高下がなんになろう。常に、謙譲でなければならない。下座のこころをわすれてはならない」 「信仰者にとって、一番大切なことは常に下座の行を忘れないことである。私どもが大きな観音力をいただいて、自分にすら思いがけない奇蹟が次々にあらわれ、人々から生神様のように尊敬されると、ともすれば、自分を実質以上に価値づけて、思い上がってしまうことがなきにしもあらずである。そして、思い上がって自己反省を忘れて来ると、それからは何もかも神様の道からはずれてしまい、しかもそれに気づかないという二重の間違いを起す。そして、最後には、みじめにも奈落に転落してしまう。よくよく気をつけなければならない」 「信仰の道は、完全な人間となるために、一歩一歩修養を積んで行くこと以外にない。それには、常に謙譲でなければならない」 「こころは常に新しく」 先生は、常にそう言っていた。 亡くなる三カ月程前、先生は、信者たちに説いて聞かせた。 「私たちは、今、だんだんと白米を食べられるようになった。戦争中は、馬も食わぬような豆粕なども食べて、白米の有難さを、しみじみと感じていた。農家でもないのに、今年の収穫はどうだろうか、二百十日は大丈夫だろうか、害虫の被害はありはしないかと、雨につけ、風につけ、心配して、農家の労苦に感謝していた。それが、この頃になって、白米も次第に豊富に出廻って来ると、つい昨日までの感謝を忘れて、ぞんざいにする。 健康についても、そうである。医者にかかり、薬を浴びる程のんでも、その他、百方手を尽くしても治らなかった。前途暗澹たるものがあった。それが、ふとしたことからこの道によって救われ、見違えるような丈夫な体になる。涙が出る程、嬉しく、いつかこの御恩報じをしなければならないと考える。それが、日がたつにつれて、いつか昔を忘れ、感謝の気持も消え失せて、傲慢不遜になる。 信仰についても、そうである。信仰の道に入った当座は、有難さ、尊さ、勿体なさを感じて、心は火のように燃えていた。それが、時のたつに従って、いつのまにか怠慢になり、形式主義になり、初めの感謝を忘れてしまう。 これらはすべて、心を新しくすることをしないからだ。 人は、信仰を口にする。しかし、その信仰に対して、自分を反省して行く人は、果して幾人あるだろうか。常に、入信当時の心を忘れず、その心が古くならないよう、今日よりは明日、明日よりは明後日と、自分の心に鞭を打って行かねばならない。流れない水は、腐る。自ら鞭うたない心は、やがて弾力を失う。心を常に新しく――これを忘れないで貰いたい」 四十六 昭和二十四年の秋、法務府のＯ氏は、箱根に出張し、旅館の一室で、先生を待っていた。 その頃、法務府は、いわゆる新興宗教の調査に当っていた。Ｏ氏は、その係りであった。 やがて、先生が入って来た。 そして、Ｏ氏にむかって、真正面から、宗教論を吹っかけた。 とうとうと説き出し、説き来り、「うちの宗教こそ最高である」と、その意気当るべからざるものがあった。 Ｏ氏は、印度哲学を専攻した学者であり、言いたいことは山ほどあったが、調査という仕事で来ている身であり、静かに傾聴していた。うなづける点もあり、うなづけない点もあった。 「では、浄霊の実際を見て貰いましょう」 最後に、先生は、そう言った。 そして、人を呼んで、次の部屋に坐らせた。そして、そのあいだの襖を締め切った。だから、その人からは、先生もＯ氏も見えない。 そうして置いて、先生は、こちらの部屋から浄霊を始めた。珍らしいものを見るように、Ｏ氏は、先生の手つきを見つめていた。 ところが、不思議なことに気がついた。 先生が掌をかざすと、見えない隣の部屋の人が、咳をはじめる。 先生が掌を下すと、その人の咳もやむ。 こういうことが二三度続いた。 （どうだ。わかったか） 先生は、そういう顔をする。 Ｏ氏は、ちょっと呑まれた形で、つぶやく。 （これは、いける！） 先生には、自信があった。殆ど誰にも批判は許さぬといわんばかりの烈々たる自信を持っていた。教義で来いという自信満々の気魄をみなぎらせていた。そして、事実、私生活などでも、大先生以外の者が、私生活についてとやかく言うと、非常に機嫌が悪かった。時には、まともに怒り出した。 （どうだ。わかったか） この顔が生涯を通じての先生の顔であったとは言わない。しかし、大先生にめぐり合ってからの先生の顔は、常に、不退転の勇猛心を現わすこの顔であった。 あとになって、Ｏ氏は、こう言っている。 「とにかく、先生は、霊力の鋭い人と思います。霊感の強い人と言ってもいいでしょう。宗教人としては、申し分のない人です。しかし、宗教行政の面では、全く駄目な人でした。言い換えれば、教祖的資質の人であって、教団組織者ではないのです。純粋、一本槍、厳格――しかし、その厳格さは、他人に対すると同様に自己に対してもそうであった。そう思いますね。私が先生に会ったのは、僅か二度しかありませんが」 四十七 昭和二十四年九月、天国会の会報「天国之友」が創刊された。 従来、各分会で謄写版あるいは活版の分会報が出ていたが、「これでは、天国会全体の動きを知ることは出来ないから」という先生の意見で、約五十頁の活版誌が出ることになったのであるが、その創刊号に載せられた「発刊に際して」という一文は、いろいろの示唆を含んでいる。 「会長先生の御意向としては、各分会長は、天国会の地域的世話人代表として、天国建設の御用をすべきであって、分会と分会との間に垣根が出来ては、会の目的と相反することになります。善言讃詞の中にもありますように、国と国との境なく、人草達の憎しみや争いごとも夢と消えて行かなくてはなりません。 天国会は、どこまでも一つであり、幾ら分会がふえても一つの会であり、ただ、会の運営上、大体地域的に分会をふやすのであって、各分会長は、総本部の直属の教師であり、各地に出張の形をとっていることをお忘れなきよう御願いいたします。 要するに、分会がふえることは、天国会が大きくなることで、一本の木に例えれば、如何に枝葉が沢山になっても、みな幹から分岐しているのと同様の理であります。幹が枯れれば、枝や葉も枯れてしまうのであります」 この「天国之友」は、次いで十月号を出したが、十一月は休み、十二月に増頁の第三号を出して、それで廃刊となった。 その理由の一つとして、大先生が、「日本観音教団として、昭和二十三年の十二月から地上天国という月刊誌を発行しているのだから、屋上屋を重ねるようなことはしない方がいい」という注意を与えたと言われる。 しかし、先生が、意識的に、屋上屋を重ねるために「天国之友」を発刊したのではないことは確かである。 これは、単に会報だけの問題ではない。先生は、あくまでも自分は大先生の下僕であるという慎みを忘れなかった。当時の日本観音教団教義にもある通り、「岡田自観先生は、観世音菩薩が人類救済のための代行者として選ばれたる力徳者たることを信じ」て、自分の生涯を、その前に投げ出していた。その大先生の言うことには、なんの口答えもすることはなかった。理屈がどうであろうと、「承知いたしました」とすぐ答えた。 この「発刊に際して」の終りにも、このことを強調することを忘れなかった。 「木の一番元は、目に見えない根であることを忘れては忘れてはなりません。大先生が、ちょうど根になられるのでありまして、幹が会長先生（創刊の辞であるから、無記名である）で、枝が各分会長で、葉が信者であります。その気が成長し、繁栄して、始めて地上天国がが出来るのであります。その木を育くむ栄養素の一部として、ここに会報が創刊されたのであります」 これは、先生だけの信念ではない。各分会長も、みなこれと同じ信念をもっていた。 その頃、分会長のＭさんは、自分が編集発行している分会ニュースの中で、次のように書いている。 「私どもは、大先生の御許に参じ、中島先生の御導きによって、観音力を戴くことが出来ました。そして、本当の宗教がもつ本当の力を知らせていただき、本当の宗教を味あわせていただきました。炎暑の中で滾々と湧き出る神力の泉に、身も魂も澄み浄められ、涼味常に身中を流るる思いに、日々を幸福に過させていただいております。なんたる幸福者でありましょう。それは、ちょうど、人々よりも一足先に苦の沙漠を過ぎて、オアシスへと中島先生に導かれ、大先生からの醍醐味を頂戴したとも言えましょう」 先生は要するに、自己に対しても相手に対しても厳格な教育者であった。 その点、一般の信者と同様に、分会を主宰する分会長といえども、手ごころは加えなかった。容赦なく、びしびしとやった。 「天国之友」を発刊する数カ月前、先生は、あるところで、こう言った。 「……また、信者の方々にお願いする。信仰は、何処までも、人を見ないで、神を中心として貰いたい。大先生の直接の教えである信仰雑話、御讃歌などに照らして分会長その他の先生を見る時、欠点だらけで、到底、宗教家として尊敬に値しないかも知れません。宗教家としては、（宗教家的活動を始めて、まだ満二年に達していないのだから）今のところは独り歩きも出来ない赤ん坊かも知れません。どうか、暫くの時日を藉していただきたい。そして彼等が立派な先生となるよう、御好意ある忠言をいただきたい。また、分会長その他の先生の言動について、不審の点がありましたら、遠慮なく私にも相談して下さい。私心を去って、お互いに手を握り、道の発展のために協力して行きましょう」 「天国之友」は、惜しくも三号で終ったが、言うならば、先生がこれを出そうと決意した心は、分会長のあいだの「和」を以て道の発展の先決条件と考えた心に外ならない。 四十八 その胸の中に、矛盾を孕んでいない人はない。矛盾こそ人間だと言っていいかも知れない。とするならば、大きな人物ほど、その胸の中の矛盾も大きいであろう。 先生も、幾多の矛盾をもっていた。直情怪行、言いたいことを言い、堅物の常として、おかしくなければ義理にも笑ってやらぬぞというようなところのあった先生だから、そとず〔づ〕らがいいとは言えない。 しかし、内面は、もっと手剛く直情的であった。次男の三六ちゃんを亡くしてからは、大分気持も弱くなったが、それでも家庭では、文字通り「厳父」であった。殊に、夫人にはきびしかった。 信者を集めての講話には、「産後の注意すべきこと。一つ、一週間は柔かい食事をとること。二つ、三週間は寝たり起きたりの程度で、過激な運動は避けること。三つ、七十五日間は新聞を読んだり、縫いもの等を控えること」などを親切に教えた先生も、夫人には、一週間も寝させては置かなかった。 これは、反面、夫人も勝気で、のうのうと寝てはいられない性分であり、寝ていては生活して行けなかった経済的な理由もあったかも知れないが、とにかく、先生は家ではきびしかった。 強い人間であったが、又弱い人であった。気が小さいところもあった。 殊に、暴力団には、弱かった。晩年、教団が大きくなり、それにつれて暴力団が、事務所に現われることも多かった。 そういう時、先生は、Ｋさんによろしく頼んで、自分は隠れていた。ある時などは、そのＫさんが、階下で暴力団と応待していると、先生は二階から、階下へ向かって、しきりに浄霊をしていた。 落ちついているように見えて、あわてん坊のところもあった。お茶の作法は、覚えたいとも思わなかったらしいが、それにしてもカラキシ駄目であった。人には、落ちつけと言っていたが、先生の心の中には、どうも落ちつけないものが何かあった。 先生は、神経質な人間が嫌いであった。けれども、先生自身も、多分に神経質なところがあった。 「気を利かせよ。気を利かせよ。気をくばれよ」と先生は、いつも言っていた。しかし、先生でも、気が利かせられないことをした。例えば、戦後、法務府の人が、教団のことを調べるために、熱海へ来た。 その人は、まず、天国会本部へ飛び込んだ。 夕方になって、食事が出た。 その人は、役目の性質上、何も食べないでただ林檎をつまみ、紅茶を飲んだだけでやめた。 その後、その人は、やはり同じ仕事の続きとして、教団の書類を検閲していた。 ところが、自分の名前が出て来て、「饗応費何円」と記してある。 一般に、こういう場合ははっきりと書かないものである。それなのに、ここにちゃんと金額まで明記してある。その人は、ちょっと首をひねった。 そのずっとあとになって、その人は、こう言っている。 「たしか、責任者は、先生だった。饗応費いくらと書いて置くなんて、あれは、先生が鷹揚だったからなのか、それとも信念なのか、性格から来ていることなのか、未だに私にはわからない」 先生は、人の欠点を見つけると、容赦なく、そこを目がけて鞭を振り下した。しかし、先生自身、欠点の多い人であった。 ただ、先生のえらかったことは、自分で自分の欠点を十分に知っていたということ、常に反省したということである。常人にはできない。 昭和十八年の終わり頃、教勢が下火になって来たことがあった。 その時も、先生は、 「私に、何か間違っているところがあるのだろう」と若い助手たちに言った。その反省は、側で見ていても、痛々しいくらいであった。 そういう先生であったから、物事の限界ということを知っていた。柄にないことはするなと、自分にも言い、人にも言っていた。 ある人が、先生に、 「私の友人が、二号の問題で、奥さんとごたごたを起していますが、どういうふうに解決したらいいでしょうか」と訊いた。 先生は、真面目な顔をして、 「君。君は、二号をもったことがあるか」 「いや。ありません」とその人は答えた。 すると、先生は、きっぱりと言った。 「経験のないことは、わからないのだから、余計なことはしないほうがいい」 だから、先生は、政治的なことは、自分はよくわからないと誰にも言い。そういう話は、全部適当な人に委せていた。そういう話となると、すぐ、その人のところに駆けつけた。 先生は、大きな人間であった。だから、大きな矛盾も持っていた。先生は、その矛盾をよく心得ていた。そこが、えらかった。 だから、先生が、亡くなったと聞き、弟子たちは、みんな泣いた。棺の前で泣き崩れた一弟子は、 「生れて初めてです。あんなに大きな声で泣いたのは。いいえ、声を出さないようにしたいと思っても、どうにもとまらなっかったのです」と言っていた。 「えらいこっちゃ。先生が亡くなられた」 そう言って、涙をポロポロこぼしながら、部屋の隅で、ひとりごとを言っている弟子もあった。 矛盾はあっても、その矛盾を包んで、先生は、大きく、強く、立派であった。 四十九 昭和二十五年、二月四日、これまでの日本観音教団と日本五六七教会を解消して、宗教法人世界救世教の一体化が実現した。 そして、教祖の称号の「大先生」は、この時から「明主」と改められた。 しかし、これより数日早く、一月三十一日の、多分午前一時頃に、先生は急逝された。 その前日、一月三十日。 先生は、鎌倉の女弟子の家へ出かけた。長男の誠八郎さんは、この分教会から、東京の大学に通っていた。 どういうつもりか、その日の朝、先生は、子供たちに、 「鎌倉のＫさんのところへ行って、みんなで晩のご飯を食べよう」と言った。 早速、仕度をして、夫人ともども家を出た。列車の中でも、春代ちゃん、光子ちゃん、和子ちゃんたちは、はしゃいでいた。 賑やかな一日が暮れた。 晩のご馳走は、スキ焼きであった。 しかし、先生はあまり食べなかった。 食後、気分が悪いと言って、先生は寝ころんで、ラジオを聞いていた。 その時、先生は、誠八郎さんに、何気ないような顔で、 「おれは、おまえに出世してくれとは言わない。人から慕われる者になって欲しいと思うよ」と言った。 先生は、これを、遺言のつもりで言ったのではないかも知れない。しかし、事実、それは誠八郎さんばかりでなく、多くの子女への遺言となった。 「私も、それを遺言と思っています」と誠八郎さんは、その日を偲んで、しみじみと言う。 まもなく、先生の気分の悪いのも治った。すくなくとも治ってしまったように見えた。 一行は、その家に下宿している長男だけを置いて、熱海へ帰って来た。家へ入った時は、もう十時になっていた。 時刻もおそかったし、寒さが沁みるような夜であったが、先生は、幹部のＡさんなどを呼んで、いろいろの話をした。好きな蜜柑も随分食べた。 そして、十二時頃、 「おれは、もう寝る」と言って、床に入った。 しばらくたって、夫人は何か胸騒ぎがするので、枕もとのスタンドをつけた。 先生は、寝ながら、自分の手で自分の頬をなでている。 （どうもおかしい） 夫人は、 「あなた」と呼びかけた。 しかし、返事はなかった。 見ると、顔色が普通ではない。 揺すっても、なんの反応もない。 夫人は、いそいでベルを押した。 Ａさんが、飛んで来た。しかし、もう目はあかなかった。口もきかなかった。 大先生も、駆けつけた。 けれども、その時は既に、心臓も停まってしまっていた。 あまりに急なことで、誰も時計を見なかった。気がついて、時計を見た時は、長針と短針はもう二時近くを示していた。 五十 父急逝の知らせを聞いて、誠八郎さんは、蒲団の上にぱっと起き上り、 「馬鹿！」と、大きな声で怒鳴った。 その声は、まだ明けやらぬ部屋の壁に、不気味にぶつかった。 昨夜、機嫌よく帰って行った父が、それから僅か数時間後には、もうこの世の人ではなくなっている。そんなことがあっていいだろうか。 文字通り、寝耳に水であった。 「馬鹿！」 それは、もちろん、父に対して言ったものではなかった。と同時に、自分に対して言ったものでもなかった。その他の誰に対して言ったものでもない。 ただ、何かに向かって、そう怒鳴らずにはいられなかった。 悲しいというような感じではなかった。くやしいという感じでもなかった。言うならば、憤懣であった。 しかし、それを何にぶつけていいのかわからなかった。 熱海の駅に降りると、熱海の町には、細かい雨がふっていた。 わが家へ入った。 しかし、なんという変化であろう。誰も、信じられないと言った表情をしていた。次から次へと駆けつけて来た人々も、みんな、突然のおどろきのためによう口もきけないという有様であった。 先生の遺体の前で、夫人は、目を赤くしていた。 昨夜――と言っても、もう十二時過ぎ、寝床に入って煙草に火をつけると、先生は、夫人に言った。 「おまえにも随分苦労をかけたが、もうこれからはよくなるぞ」 夫人は、その言葉を思い出し、幾度も胸の中で噛みしめていた。 と、急に涙があふれて来た。夫人は、それを押さえるようにして、弔問客に頭を下げた。 （あの人は、多分今夜、自分が死ぬだろうということを知っていたのだ） 涙の目で、立ち昇る線香の煙も、霞んで見えた。 隣の部屋に、声を出して泣き崩れている弟子の一人の姿が見えた。 葬儀は、四日の立春祭をすませたあと、二月五日に、熱海で執り行われた。 冷たい霙（みぞれ）が降っていた。 そして、東京中野の松源寺に葬った。 この寺は、その門前に石の猿が据えてあるので、俗に猿寺と呼ばれている。 こうして、東京の各新聞が、「日本観音教団岡田茂吉の高弟没す」と報道したその先生は、五十一才で地上を離れ、それから五年後、昭和三十年二月十日、七十三才で昇天された教祖――大先生の露払いとして、天国に赴いたのであった。 おわりに 昭和二十四年十一月、湯川秀樹博士は、ノーベル物理学賞を受けた。 中島先生は、直ちに筆を採って、書いた。 「湯川博士の湯川粒子発見は、日本はもちろん、全世界の賞賛の的となっている。しかしながら、われらはこの発見に対し、反対に恐怖心を増すものである。なんとなれば、今思い出してもぞっとするあの広島や長崎を一瞬にして潰滅させた原子爆弾の大悲劇は、われらの未だ記憶に新たなるところである。又、最近のワシントン特電によれば、米国科学専門家達の原爆に対する研究は、いよいよ進歩し、広島長崎の原爆の数千倍の破壊力を持っているとのことで、これを聞くにつれ、いよいよ恐怖は募る一方である。又、地球の一角において、これを高度から爆発させたとすると、地球上の生物は全部潰滅せしめ得るそうである。われらは、ここに新しく中性〔間〕子の発見を聞いて、喜ぶべきか、悲しむべきか、静かに考えなくてはならない。ただ、われらが喜ぶべき点は、現代科学が、目に見えざる世界へ、即ち霊的方面に一歩一歩前進しつつある事実を証明して呉れていることである」 その頃の先生の関心は、「世界」にあった。第二次大戦は終ったが、それに続く二大強国間の「冷たい戦争」は、日とともに激しくなって行く。 そして、もし、それが何処かで発火し、第三次大戦にまで延焼したら、原爆が使用されたら――そう考えると、先生は、居ても立っても居られない気持になるのであった。 「誰しも苦悩のない人はいない。人が信仰するのは、この苦悩から逃れ――換言すれば、不幸から幸福な者になりたいためである」 先生は、そう言った。 しかし、それだけでは済まされない。 湯川博士の受賞が発表される二カ月前に、先生は、こう言った。 「いくら自分の家庭、郷土、日本が救われても、原子爆弾による世界戦争が起ったとしたら、個人の幸福も、日本の幸福もあったものではない。今後は、世界人類を目標として、ものを考え、処理して行くべきである。信仰も又、世界人の幸福を祈り、自分の幸福を祈るものでなくてはならない。個人を離れて世界もなく、世界を離れて個人もあり得ないからである」 思えば、先生は、日清戦争と日露戦争のあいだの「谷間の平和」とも言うべき明治三十二年に生れた。 その翌年、朝鮮に義和団の乱があり、日本は出兵した。 十五才の時、明治は大正と改元されたが、僅か二年後には、第一次大戦が勃発した。遂には、日本もこれに参加、東洋で戦った。 続いて、昭和六年満州事変が起り、七年に五・一五事件、十一年に二・二六事件と、国内は騒然たるものがあったが、翌十二年には遂に日華事変が勃発した。 そして、十四年には第二次大戦の幕が切って落され、十六年十二月八日、日本は列強を向うに廻して、太平洋戦争の火蓋を切ったが、苦闘四年の後、二十年八月十五日、無条件降伏をした。――惨憺たる戦後。 そうして、先生は、「冷たい戦争」の結果として起った朝鮮動乱の数カ月前、昭和二十五年一月の終りに没した。 先生の五十年の生涯は、はっきりと三つの時代に分けることが出来る。 一つは、海外雄飛の夢を抱いていたが、ついに実現しないで終った青少年時代。 一つは、生活のためにサラリーマンとなったが、われら如何に生くべきかの問題に悩んだ暗中模索時代。 一つは、岡田茂吉なる人物に会い、神を発見して、ひたすらに宗教家としての活動を続けた時代。 そして、その最後において、先生は、宗教も、学問も、芸術も、すべて世界人類の福祉に貢献するものでなければならないこと、世界人類が全部、その手と手を結び、地球をめぐって「恒久平和」の輪舞をする日が、必ず到来することを信じて目を閉じた――と言っては当らないであろうか。 昭和二十六年十月三日の栄光に載せられた大先生（この時は、明主と改称されていた）の「世界人たれ」を、ここに謹んで転載させていただく。日本観音教時代既に世界宗教を期していた中島一斉先生を偲びながら―― 「これからの人間は、世界人にならなければ駄目だ。これについて面白い話がある。 終戦直後、ある軍人上りの人が私のところへ来て、憤懣（ふんまん）に堪えない面持（おももち）で“今度の降伏はどう考えても分らない”と言って、憤慨しながら話かけるのだが、私の方はサッパリ気が乗らないので、彼は呆れたらしく“先生は日本人ですか”ときくから、即座に私は“日本人じゃない”と答えると、彼はギョッとして、震えながら“ではどこの国の人間ですか”ときき返すので、私は言ってやった。“つまり世界人なんですよ”その言葉に、彼はポカンと気の抜けたような顔をして、その意味の納得のゆくまで説明してくれろと言うので、私も色々話してやったが、今それを土台にしてかいてみよう。 元来日本人とか、支那人とか言って、差別をつけるのが第一間違っている。あの頃の日本人がそれで、日清、日露の二回の戦役に勝ち、急に一等国の仲間入りをしたのでのぼせ上り、日本は神国なりなどと、何か特別の国のように思ったり、思わせたりして、ついにあのような戦争まで引き起したのである。 そんな訳だから、他国民を犬猫のように侮蔑し、その国の人間を殺すなど何とも思わず、思いのままに他国を荒し廻ったので、ついに今日のような敗戦の憂き目を見る事になったのである。そのように自分の国さえよけりゃ、人の国などどうなってもいいというような思想がある限り、到底世界の平和は望めないのである。 これを日本の国だけとしてたとえてみても分る。ちょうど県と県との争いのようなものとしたら、日本内の事であるから、言わば兄弟同士の食（は）み合いで、簡単に型〔片〕がつくに決っている。この道理を世界的に押し拡げればいいのである。 かの明治大帝の御製にある有名な“四方（よも）の海みな同胞（はらから）と思ふ世に、など波風の立ち騒ぐらむ”すなわちこれである。みんなこの考えになれば、明日からでも世界平和は成立つのである。全人類が右のような広い気持になったとしたら、世界中どの国も内輪同士という訳で、戦争など起りよう訳がないではないか。 この理によって今日でも何々主義、何々思想などといって、その仲間のグループを作り、他を仇（かたき）のように思ったり、ヤレ国是だとか、何国魂とか、何々国家主義だとか、神国などと言って、一人よがりの思想が、その国を過（あやま）らせるのみか、世界平和の妨害ともなるのである。 だからこの際少なくとも日本人全体は、今度の講和を記念として、世界人となり、今までの小乗的考えを揚棄（ようき）し、大乗的考えになる事である。これが今後の世界における、最も進歩的思想であって、世界はこの種の人間を必要とするのである」 ――――――――――・―――――――・―――――――――― 中島一斉先生とそれぞれの因縁を結ばれておられる多くのかたがたに御会いし、一カ年に亘って口述筆記したものを土台として、この本が出来上がったわけですが、聞きちがいや表現のつたなさから、先生の真の姿を誤り伝えているところがあるかもしれません。 もしそういうところがあるならば、その責任はすべて筆者である私にあります。口述してくださったかたがた、この本の中に登場するかたがたに深く御詫びします。 麻生 鋭 ――――――――――・―――――――・―――――――――― rattail（注） 本書に引用の御論文「世界人たれ」は少し手が加えられています。ほとんど問題とするに当らないところですが、最後の一文が省略されていますので、ここに掲載します。 「話は違うが宗教などもそれと同じで、何々教だとか、何々宗、何々派などといって、派閥など作るのは、最早時代遅れである。ところが自慢じゃないが本教である。本教が他の宗教に対して、触るるな〔な〕どというケチな考えはいささかもない。反って触るるのを喜ぶくらいである。というのは本教は全人類を融和させ、世界を一家のごとくする平和主義であるからで、この意味において、本教ではいかなる宗教でも、仲間同志と心得、お互いに手を携え、仲良く進もうとするのである。」 また中島先生の訃報に触れられた際の明主様のお言葉が残っています。 〔 中島氏帰幽に関するお言葉 、S25. 2.** 、岡田茂吉全集 講話篇 3-345〕

――― 関 連 出 版 物 ――― 稲作十二カ月 『稲作十二カ月』昭和30年1月1日発行 序 自然農法普及会副会長 渡辺 勝 自然農法の原理とは、土の偉力を発揮させることである。大自然の万物は「火、水、土」の三元素によって生成化育するものである。そこで農作物にもこの三元素を豊富にするため、日当りをよくし、水分を十分に吸収させ、土を清くすれば、あらゆる作物は自らの生命力と、大自然の恵みによって、完全豊実（ほうじつ）するという極めて明白な条理につきるのである。ところが既存農法は、大自然の力を無視して、作物の母体である土本来の働きを軽視している。特に、肥料を作物の栄養源であるかの如く、錯覚しているところに根本的誤りがある。この事実は、永年にわたり、金肥や人糞を多量に施こし、土に対し一片の愛情すら与えず乱用する結果、作物収量の限界点に達していることによって十分証明されるであろう。有肥農法の根本的誤謬がここに指摘されるわけである。既存農法の欠陥はさらに深刻なものがある。即ち金肥、人糞等の施肥による悪循環は、農作物の成長期にこれを弱体化し、風水等や寒冷に耐ゆる抵抗力を弱め、病虫等にも犯され易くなり、これがため年々歳々減収の悲境に陥っている。自然農法は、創始者が、行詰った日本農法を革新し、人類の福祉をこれによって増進せんとする発意から提唱したもので、既に十年の歴史をもち、全国到るところに耕作実施者は普及している。自然農法の強味は、その原理をわきまえ、これを実施すれば必ず初年度より増産確実となり、その実証が全国各地で裏づけされていることである。 本書は、これら実施者のために、より一層の増産に資し、未経験者のためには親切な手引きとなり、一面、自然農法の原埋を理解せず、あるいは、自然農法による増収の実証に懸念を抱く人々を啓蒙するため、特に米作に主力を置き「稲作十二カ月」をとりあげたのである。ただ注意を要することは、米作技術について、土地の状況により多少の工夫を要する点がある。その点をよく研究考慮し、本書を熟読玩味して忠実に実施されたい。 昭和三十年一月 自然農法三原則 一、肥料 農薬 １、金肥等各種化学肥料は使用せぬこと。 ２、堆肥、厩肥、人糞尿、鶏糞その他、一切の糞尿は使用せぬこと。 ３、れんげ、草等、木灰、藁灰、焼土等は使用せぬこと。 ４、その他人為肥料として用いるものは一切使用せぬこと。 ５、消毒その他の農薬は一切使用せぬこと。 二、土 １、自然農法とは大自然の法則「火、水、土」の耕作法である。 ２、土は肥料そのものであるから、土を清浄にすればよい。 ３、土の分量（耕作土）をふやすこと。 ４、初めて深耕する時は必ず客土をすること。 三、種子 苗 １、種子は過去に肥毒を吸収していない清浄なものを用いること。 無肥の種子の入手出来ない場合は、同じ圃場（ほじょう）で毎年繰り返して連作して無肥化すること。 ２、種子は何品種でもよいが、遠隔地のものは使用せぬほうがよい。 ３、苗作りは太くて、短く、堅い健全なるものを作ること。 自然農法は右の三原則を堅く守ること。 十 二 月 行 事 一、土作り １、自然農法は土が生命だから、土作りが一番重要である。 ２、時期は稲の刈取後、速かに耕起準備をする。原則としては、藁は使用してはいけない。 ３、粘りのない土、また締り易い砂壌土（さじょうど）の場合、藁を少量使用するとよい。 ４、新開地、寒冷地帯等必要な揚合は、成るべく短く切った藁をこの月中に一面に撒布する。その場合でも反当五十貫位を適量とする。 ５、藁を使用する場合は風化作用がよく行われるように熱を持たせて使うと、なおよい。 （注意）田植間際に藁を使用すると必ず失敗する。 ６、一度深耕客土した田は、そのままで六寸ないし七寸耕起、砕土すればよい。 ７、田に客土用の土や藁等を積んで置くと、土の呼吸を止めたり、病虫がつきやすいから、絶対に積まないこと。また藁等の焚火を田でしてはいけない。 ８、培土の必要な田。 （１） 新しく作った水田。 （２） 耕土の極く浅い田の耕土を一度に増した場合。 （３） 分蘖（ぶんけつ）が非常に困難な田。 （註）培土の作り方l 〇三四カ月後掻混ぜて使う。 ○藁は五分位に切る。 ９、新しく畑を水田に作り換えた揚合は山土（表土より三尺下の土）を五千貫位、入れること。 （注意）三月以降（寒中を経た後）は深掘り天地返しをすると失敗する。 二、深 耕 １、深耕に際しては、床（肥毒の層一寸五分二、三寸位）は全部起すように努めたい。―― （既耕土の五割増位まで） ２、起す場合、必ず底土は耕土の上部に置くように耕起する。 ３、冬期中に底士を砕土風化させ、肥毒の浄化に努める。 ４、決して一度に深耕せず、耕土が浅い場合は、その耕土を一尺程度にするのに二、三年かかるもよし。 ５、水田の深耕のための水持ちについて、冠水をかければ水持ちは心配いらない。 （注意） （１） 実施初年度の場合、新土を上部に出し過ぎると失敗することがある。 （２） 深耕した時、砕土を怠ると肥毒が残り失敗する。 三、客 土 １、客土の目的は、肥毒中和のためであるから、反当三千貫位を適当とする。 ２、深耕の遅れた場合、また間に合わぬ時は、一千貫二千貫行えば、初年度にても秋落――ち、病虫害は解消する。 ３、初年度に深耕を実施した場合は、必ず三千貫位の客土を実施する。 ４、客土の場合は、肥毒のない土、すなわち山土なれば表土を除き、その下の土を客土する。出来れば赤土を可とする。 ５、時期は、春の耕作まで何時でもよいが、前年度美しく十分結実しなかった田は、必ず客土すれば失敗はない。 ６、七、八寸以上ある沼田または泥炭地は深耕せず、四千貫五千貫客土するのが最もよ――い。 一 月 行 事 一、不整地苗代の準備 １、苗代田の乾いた時期を見て、前年度刈取ったままで耕起せず、稲株は田面すれすれに切り取り実施する。 ２、四尺の畝に一尺の溝を作る。畝を作る場合に、古い鎌で印を付けるとよい。 ３、四尺の畝には、一分切の藁を重ならないように一面に撒布する。 ４、一尺の溝から四寸までの土を、四尺畝の藁の上にのせる。（表土は清浄であるから） ５、一尺の溝から上げた土が乾いた時期を見て、細かく砕いておく。播種期まで草の生えないように時々手入れをする。 二、覆土の準備 １、苗代用（種子播き付け）後の覆土として坪当り六貫程度の肥毒のない土（山土を可とす）を準備する。そして播種期頃までに、細かく砕けるように注意する。 ２、覆土は前年度七、八月頃より取入れ準備をするとよい。 ３、雨に合わせると固まる土と砕ける土があることにもよく留意する必要がある。 （注意） （１） 不整地苗代は深耕して行うと失敗する。 （２） 固まりのある土を覆土に使用すると、分蘖をさまたげて失敗する。 二、三 月 行 事 一、土の清浄化 １、耕起後、なお土の清浄化を徹底するために、耕し返しを行うとよい。肥毒の多量の田は特に実行したい。 ２、耕起の遅れているところでも、二月未までには必ず耕起してしまうよう努める。初年度深耕の場合は、凍りつく中に耕し返しをし、風化作用に努めるとよい。 ３、深耕を実施した水田にして特に水持ちの悪いと思われる土地は、前もって雪または雨水を受け、土に十分水を配すように注意する。 ４、乾いた時期を見はからって、囲った土を細かく砕き、風化作用と雑草の生えないように手入れする。 ５、肥毒の層が強い場合は、この期間中に二、三度耕起砕土すると最もよい。 ６、深耕した場合、出来れば流し水（人為洪水）をすればなおよい。 ７、遅れて本農法を実施する者は、特に客土、風化を必要とする。 （注意） 深耕した場合風化砕土を怠ると失敗する。 四 月 行 事 一、播種期の決定 １、品種の特長を知り、早生品種は少し早目に、苗代期間五十日ないし六十日。植付後六十日後に出穂という耕作法が良いと思われる。 ２、植付後、出穂までに六十日ないと茎数（分蘖）が少いので、その点に留意して、播種期の決定をすると良い。 二、苗代の完備 苗代の準備してあるところ（表土の砕いてある）を、水平に直し、苗代の面積を調べる。……四尺畝に九尺が一坪である。一反に対し十坪の苗代を準備する。 三、籾種浸水 籾種（もみだね）はきれいな流れ水（川の水）にすかして見える迄浸種する。 四、播付け １、四月下旬五月上旬、播付けを行うが、条播機あるいは手播きの場合にも、急ぐこと――なく確実に播種する。 ２、播種量は反当り三合（坪当り三勺）が適量だが、不足の心配ある時は面積を少し増せばよい。 不整地苗代は上図のように実施するを理想とする。 ３、播種後、前以って用意した山土（坪当り六、七貫目）を覆う。 ４、覆土の目的は草を防ぐためと鳥に拾われないため。 ５、不整地苗代の効果は、苗が健全にして病気にならない。 五、普通苗代 １、不整地苗代困難の揚合は、従来の方法を取る場合、極力薄播にし日時を一日でも多く苗代に置くようにすれば強い苗が出来る。 ２、普通苗代の揚合も坪当り五勺、薄いくらいをよしとする。 ３、地方によりどうしても保温苗代をする時は、発芽後は逐次寒風に当て、長く保温せず、寒さに負けない苗を作ることが大切である。 （注意）発芽期に雀に拾われぬよう、覆土の表面に籾殻を少量撒くとよい。 五、六 月 行 事 １、播き付け後は深水にして発芽し鳥等が拾わないようになれば、水は溝にあるようにし、苗場にはつかない程度でよい。 ２、不整地苗代の時、苗の発育が遅れたと思う時は、板切れに一寸釘を三本位打ち付けて、苗の株間を一度かき起せば分蘖するようになる。 ３、苗の発育が、五、六本以上に成育しそうな時は、植付けの十五日前頃、鎌（かま）で株間を一筋だけ切れば分蘖はピタリ止まる。 ４、苗を取る時は、深水にして取る。土はあまり洗い落さない方がよい。 二、本田準備 １、水漏れをよく調べ、悪い個所があれば畦をつき直し、修理すること。 ２、植付けをする四、五日前までに山や池を作らぬよう平面にかきならすことに忠実なること。 ３、水をつけてから土をねらない程よい。ねると水の乾いた時、割れやすい。 ４、水持の悪い田は、床粘（とこね）りをするとよい。 ５、粘りのない土（泥になっていない土）は少しは粘った方がよい。 三、植付け １、苗は強いのを一本植えにされたい。苗代期間の長い苗は、力があるから必ず分蘖する。 ２、坪当りの最大分蘖数は、六、七百本から千本以内を最もよしとす。 （注意）千本以上に分蘖する場合は減収しやすい。 ３、耕土四寸以下の浅いところ、また日照時間の少い土地等は、株間は適宜でよいが、本数は必ず一本植が良好である。 ４、株間は普涌一尺一尺二寸位を適当とする。耕土が五寸以上あれば土の活動が容易であ×り、温暖寒冷の影響も少いので、なるべく株間を広くされたい。 ５、根を傷めぬよう苗に愛情を持って、浅植にするとよい。 ６、苗は三本――六本に分蘖したのを良しとする。 （注意）六本以上分蘖した苗を使用すると、失敗する。 ◎（直播は目下指導部で研究中） 四、植付後の潅水 植付後は常時浅水で潅水するとよい。 七、八、九 月 行 事 一、除草及び潅漑 １、一番除草は植付後十日までにガンヅメで深く中耕する。二番除草は反対側から二寸位行うとよい。 ２、二番除草は一番除草後、一週間位で根本の草取り、土かきをする。 ３、七月末日までに三番除草を行う。三番除草は根本の土を除き、小さい草も取れるようにする。 ４、分蘖不十分の時は、四番除草もするとよい。 ５、土用干も不要。土用中は特に潅水に注意し、土割のしないよう努めること。 ６、八月下旬、九月上旬には出穂期（でほき）と成るので、その時期には水田に入ってはいけない。 ７、一般に水枯れのため乾くのは止むを得ない。（ただし落水後、旱（ひでり）の時は一週間目位に刈取るまで、水のかけ流しをすると、一回毎に反当八升位青実が無く結実する） 二、落水の時期 １、乳熟期を過ぎ、籾がやや硬化するときを待ち、排水するを最適とする。 ２、照り込みの場合、地割のするような場合は、浸水するを良しとする。 三、来年の準備 ◎不整地苗代を実施する者は、覆土をこの月に確保する。 十、十一 月 行 事 一、採種 １、肥毒の無い土地で、稲が健康に育った自然年度の古いもの程よい。なお美しくそろって結実したものなれば申分がない。 ２、病虫害または秋落ちした種子は使用しないこと。 ３、品種は、付近で獲れたものならなんでもよい。 ４、籾種は、同一田の種子を使用するを最も可とする。 ５、塩水田のところは、成るべく同地方の種子を選ぶと良い。 ６、親穂を除いた次に長い穂を、三本位選ぶのが最良である。 ７、一株中、穂先がそろったその穂先半分を採取するとよい。 ８、十分稔実（ねんじつ）しない七分色付いた時、取るのを最良の時期とする。（胴割しない物） ９、採種した種子は日蔭で乾し、保管する。 二、籾種の保管方法 【参考】 １、籾の入れ物は小さな俵を作って入れる。 ２、俵と箱の間隔は三寸程がよい。 ３、箱は隙のあるよう、雑な箱でよい。 ４、日光の当らぬ蔭に置くこと。

岡 田 自 観 師 の 論 文 集 関連出版物 中島一斉先生 ――その信仰と生涯―― 麻生 鋭 伝記こそわが恋人 財団法人 新宗連専務理事 大石秀典 先人の捨身精進の跡をさぐり、そこから、自分の信仰の至らざるを厳しくむちうち、求道の心を燃えあがらせてもらえるような糧を汲みとりたいと、いつも願っているせいか、宗教家の語録や伝記を特に好んで読むのが、私のくせである。 そのほうが、深遠な高尚な、しかし冷たい聖典や教義書を読むよりは、はるかに素晴らしい感動にゆすぶられ、じぶんの今だしを深刻に反省させられることが多い。おそらく、法を求め道をたずねる人たちのうちには、私と同じような傾向をもっている人が多いのではあるまいか。 そんなわけで、心をくだき身を削って道をわけ登った宗教家の伝記が出されるということは、その道の人から云ってもその道の人でないものから云っても、まことにうれしいものである。 ところがその伝記であるが、昔は文明が高度でなかったから、宗祖とか教祖とかいわれる人や偉大な宗教家の伝記は、幾世代にもわたる弟子たちの手を経てつくられ、さらに、それが筆写によって求道者から求道者へと伝わったのであるから、おそらく、広く読まれるようには何十年も、ときには何百年もの歳月を要したことであろう。 然るに、今は、紙もあり余るほどあり、鉛筆もあればペンもあり、そのうえまた、テープレコーダーや印刷術が非常に発達しているのであるから、沢山な伝記が短日月の間に出版されてもよい筈である。にもかかわらず、一般の出版物にくらべて伝記の方は、極めて少ないように思われる。これは、伝記を書くということがたいへんに困難なためなのではないであろうか。 伝記を書くことについての困難性は、いろいろある。私などは、記憶力が人並みはずれて弱いせいか、じぶんのことのくせに、過去の大事なことでも殆ど忘れてしまっている。たんねんに日記でもつけていない限り、よほど印象のつよかったもののほかは、ボンヤリしてしまっているのが、世の人のさがではあるまいか。してみると、なくなってしまった人の生前のあれもこれもを正確にたずねるということは、難中の難事といってもよかろう。 特に宗教家の場合には、その人の歴年譜よりも、その心がどのように変化し、あるいは、その信仰がどのように深まり高まりあっていったかという、どちらかといえば、ほかの人には見えない心の中のことが重大であるだけに、その心のうちにまでふみこんで正鵠を得るということは、常人には手のとどかないことかも知れない。かといって、自分勝手に立ち入りすぎて想像をたくましうすれば、伝記小説になってしまう。しかも宗教家の伝記では、歴年譜よりも、この困難極まることのほうが重要なのであるから、宗教家の伝記を書くことほど始末におえないことはないと言ってもよかろう。 信仰は、理論ではなく、体験の領分のことだから、その人が高くいっていればいるほど、深くいっていればいるほど、書こうとする人にとっては、とりつくしまもなく、絶望にうちひしがれることもあろう。 この中島一斉先生の伝記の筆者である麻生さんは、その絶望的困難をおして、しかも、一年に足らない短日月の間に、調査し研究し、資料を整理して、これだけのものを書きあげたのであるから、その勇気と努力には、心から敬意を表せざるを得ない。 また、おそらく、企画の方から分量の制限をうけていたのであろうが、中島先生を直接には殆ど知らない麻生さんが、これだけの文章のうちに、余すところなくとでも言いたいほど中島先生の真骨頂を伝え誌しえた、その力量にもただ頭をさげるばかりである。 こうして書いている文章自身が暴露しているように、私の文章は、一文の句切りが長くて、書き出しと結末をつなぐのに、読者は苦労されるであろう。いわばズルズルベッタリの文章である。だから、読む人に興味も感動も与えない。読み終えて、さてなにが書いてあったのだろうと思うのが、オチである。 それにひきかえ、麻生さんの文章は、一文の句切りが極めて短い。いわゆるハギレの良い文章で、読む人に強い印象を与える迫力をもっている。いわば、これが、今と、そしてこれからの文章のあり方なのである。 私が、いつも自分の構文の欠点に悩んでいるせいか、特に、この書物の麻生さんの、簡潔で、しかも淡淡として、妙に力んでいない文章に、強く心をひかれるのである。 ただ欲を言わせてもらえば、これは正規の伝記であるから、文中に出てくる人には、みんな、本名をいれてもらいたかった。もっとも、それらの人たちが、いまだ生存しておられて、さしさわりがあったのなら、仕方のないことでもあったろうが。 さて、救世教からは、本格的な教祖伝は、まだ刊行されていない。 これは、救世教のみでなく、一般に、教祖を霊界に見送ってしまった教団で、その教祖伝に関連して思うことは、教祖から救われ、親しく教えを受けた直弟子がたが、まだ霊界に旅立たれない間に、その一代記を、特に教祖を中心に意識した信仰記を、やがてそれが教祖伝の重要な資料になるという意味で、今から作っておいたらどうであろうかということであろうかということである。今は、録音機という便利手軽なものがあるのであるから、昔の人たちの骨身を削る思いの労苦にくらべれば、なんでもないとも言えるくらいのことであろう。 中島先生は、すでにこの世になく、その伝記の筆者の麻生さんが直接先生にあって調べたわけではないから、この書物にそうした教祖観を求めるのは無理な話である。しかし、ともかく、先生の十年祭を記念するものとして、この伝記を刊行された中島先生門下のかたがたにも、これは先生に対するご恩報謝であるとともに、教団に対しても一つの大きい功績であると敬意を表したい。 さて救世教で私の始めて会ったかたは、渋井総斉先生である。昭和二十三年の暮れもおし迫った頃、ある方に随行して玉川上野毛の宝山荘であったか、あそこで、いわば非公式に会ったのである。それから、公式にも非公式にも、度々、おあいする機会があった。それは渋井先生のほうが中島先生より長命であられたからである。 それにくらべると、中島先生には、昭和二十四年の秋頃から、二度くらいしか、おあいする機会はなかった。 この伝記にも、それらしい場面が出ているのであるが、最後に、箱根の旅館で私が中島先生の訪問をうけて、二人の間で宗教論が出ようとしたところで、急な要用のために先生が帰ってしまわれた事を今でもハッキリ覚えている。まことに口おしい分れで、大変残念に思っている。 この時に、先生には、この若ぞうを……と言っても、私は先生より四つしか年下でないのだが、信仰という面から、先生は、きっと、私をそう見られただろうと思っているのであるが……説服せずにおくものかという気迫が見えた。私は、無心というか、構えのない構えで対していたと思っているが、しかし、あの夜、先生に暇があって、心ゆくまで説き来り説き去って、ということになっていたら、どんなことになっていたろうと、その時のことを思い出すたびに、今でも、総身がひきしまる思いがするのである。 とにかく、それだけのことであったが、宗教家としては、めづらしく厳しい、しかも行事綿密というか、そんな印象が今でも強く残っている。 何かのことで、中島先生のことを思い出すと、その宗教をくらべるわけではないが、中島先生は、宗教家としては、道元禅師のような風格というのか、そんな型のかたであったろうと思えてならない。おなくなりになった年令もほぼ同じである。 中島・渋井という岡田教祖の二大弟子を考えないでは、救世教は考えられないほどのかたであったわけ〔で〕あるが、ちょうど、お釈迦さまより先に、その二大弟子であった舎利弗尊者と目連尊者とがこの世を去ってしまったのに似て、お一人は教祖さんより先に、霊界に行ってしまわれた。言わば、教祖さんの露払いの役をなされた。そしてもうお一人は教祖さんの昇天の直後に、これは太刀持とでも言う姿で他界された。まことにおしみても余りあることであった。もしも、お二人が現存しておられたとしたら、救世教の地図はどう変わっていただろうと思うことがある。これも凡夫の愚痴であろうか。 しかし、いまでも、教祖さんが救世教に生きておられると同様に、中島先生も、救世教の多くの信者さんのうちに生きていられるのである。 そして、さらにまた、この伝記によって、先生は、これからも、いつまでも、ひろく強く生き続けていかれるであろう。 昭和三十六年七月二十三日 はじめに 「中島先生の生涯の指導原理は？」と訊かれれば、「それは良心であった」と答えたい。 良心――それが先生の至上命令であった。 これは信仰に入らない前も、そうであったし、信仰に入ってからも、そうであった。 先生は、常に、良心という鏡の前で、強く反省し、鞭うち続けた。この点、自分というものに対して、あまりに峻厳であり過ぎた。 同様に、相手に対しても、あまりに峻厳であり過ぎた。容赦なく、強く反省を求め、鞭うった。弱い弟子は落伍した。 ただ、信仰に入らない前は、あくまでも自力で、自分というものの完成が出来ると考えていたが、信仰に入ってからは、その自力ですらも、すべて神の支援によってのみ可能であるということを知った。 言い換えるならば、土俵に上ったからには、全力を出して相撲をとらなければならないが、相手は誰か、そして勝星はどちらのものかは、すべて神の計画の中のものであることを悟ったのであった。 もともと、先生は、性格的にも激情の人であった。中途半端のままでいることの出来ない人であった。すべてか、然らずんば、無の人であった。 例えば、一生を過すにも、燈心をひたした皿に油を満たし、それに火をつけて、自他共に安穏に照らして生きるということを、いさぎよしとしなかった。そういうやり方では、満足することが出来なかった。むしろ己の「身をえぐり、肉を出して、深さ大銭の如からしめ。蘇油（そゆ）以て中にそそぎ、千燈柱をつくって」（仏祖統記）燃えようとした。自分自身を、ぼうぼうと燃やし尽くそうとした。肉は焼け、骨もあらわになる。 先生は、これこそ、男の本懐と考えた。 しかし、信仰が、先生を変えた。 良心を人生指針とすることに変りはなかったが、そのために極度に自分をいじめることを、先生はやめた。「自己拷問」から脱け出した。 信仰は、まず、先生に、生きていることの喜びと感謝を湧かせた。自分という人間を生かせてくれる者への深い感謝が、先生を明るくした。人生に微笑が訪れた。 その先生が、晩年、こう書いている。 「笑いは天国です。大いに笑い、大いに笑わせましょう。最初は、嘘でもいいのです。おかしくなくても笑いなさい。面白くなくても笑いなさい。それでは偽りだという譏（そし）りがあるかもしれないが、それでもいいのです。最初から、なんでも本物はないのです。嘘も本物になるのです。みんな心から笑えるようになれば、それが天国です。明らかに、上品に、大いに笑い、笑わせましょう」 しかし、良心は、生涯、先生の生命の根本であった。良心の命ずる行為の中にこそ神は住み給うと、弟子たちに教えた。 「信仰の極致――それは、腹の中に汚い塵や垢を洗い落し、澄みきった心となって、ひたすら大愛の神に誠を捧げること。言いかえるならば、“行”の中で行きぬくこと」 先生は、いつもそう言った。 まことに、先生こそ、良心の人、行の人である。真の意味のおいて、身を削って生きた大修行者であった。 一 一斉・中島武彦は、明治三十二年二月二十六日、山口県萩の川島という静かな農村に生れた。 中島家は、遠く藤原鎌足を祖先とする旧家で、吉田松陰の家系ともつながりがあり、父の善三郎氏は、村の小学教員をしていたが、漢学の造詣が深く、特に詩作を好み、乞われるままに史記、十八史略などを村民に教えた。 晩年、同じ萩の川上小学校長となったが、中風のため五十五歳で歿した。 母のあきさんは、同郷田中氏の息女で、長男武彦に続いて、貞子、寿子、謙二、慶介の四児を挙げた。現在八十六歳、箱根強羅の山荘で、平和な余生を送っている。 先生は、まるまると肥った、可愛い赤児であった。 萩の郊外に、一般に「塩湯」と呼んでいた温泉場があった。 ある時、母親は、生れたばかりの赤児を、それへ連れて行った。 湯につかっていると、湯治に来ている女の客は、 「なんて可愛い赤ちゃんでしょう。抱かせてくださいな」 そう言って、赤児を抱きたがった。 どの女の客も、みんなそうしたがった。 誰でも頬ずりしたくなるような、そんな可愛い赤児であった。 赤児は、丈夫で、胎毒もなく、すくすくと育って行った。 「本当に、手のかからない子ですよ」 母親は、そう自慢した。 そう自慢するだけあって、風邪一つ引かない丈夫な子であった。 数え年七つで父が勤めていた川島小学校に入学したが、頭がよく、学課の成績はよかった。 家でも、よく言うことをきく、世話のかからない少年であった。 ただ、負けることが嫌いで、その時分、剣道を習い初め、土地の警察署の道場へ出かけて、竹刀を振り回していたが、負けるととても口惜しがった。 だから､上達は早かった。試合に出て、褒美をもらったこともあった。 習字も好きで、よく手習いをしていたが、これも負けじ魂のあらわれで、六年生の時、教育勅語を立派に書いて出して、学校から賞を貰って帰って来た。 とにかく、人に負けるということが大嫌いであった。それは、どうにも我慢のならないことであった。 しかし、素直であった。 曲がったことには、何処までもぶつかって行くが、そうでないことには、至って素直で、むしろ同情心が強過ぎるくらいであった。 人に物をやるのが好きで、手もとにあるものは、片っぱしからやってしまう。 アコーデオンもやってしまえば、空気銃もやってしまった。気前のいい少年であった。 両親にも愛され、学校の先生にも愛されて、幸福な毎日であった。六年を卒業するまで、三番とは下らなかった。 二 少年は、萩中学へ進んだ。 中学でも、出来る生徒であった。 二年の時、軍人を志望して、幼年学校の試験を受けた。 試験の成績はよかったが、体格審査ではねられた。 「君は、成績がいいが、惜しいことに視力が弱い。主計なら、合格させてやるが、どうだ」 試験官は、そう言った。 少年は、黙って、引き下がってきた。 （主計じゃいやだ。主計なんか、軍人じゃない） 少年は、意気消沈して、試験場の山口から家まで、十三里の道を、歩きづめに歩いて帰ってきた。 帰ってくると、玄関に立ったまま、しくしく泣き出した。 母親は、びっくりした。 （くやしい、くやしい） 少年は、言葉には出さず、いかにも口惜しそうに、いつまでも泣いていた。 少年は軍人になるのをあきらめて、又学校へ戻った。こつこつと勉強しつづけた。 中学を卒業する時、受持の教師は、 「君は、学課の成績がいいし、将来大いに伸びると思う。どうだ、同文書院へ入って見ないか」と言った。 事実、少年には、大陸に雄飛したいという夢があった。入れるものなら、それへの最短距離として、中国の同文書院へ入りたいと考えた。そして、そのことを両親に相談した。 父親は、反対した。 「お前は長男だ。そんな遠くへ行かなくてもよろしい」と言うのであった。 「あきらめます」 少年は、素直に、そう返事した。しかしやっぱり悲しかった。 仕方なく、母校の萩中学校の代用教員になった。自分と余り年の差のない生徒を教えていた。 しかし、青雲の志は、やっぱりなくなってはいなかった。なくなるどころか、火山の地底のように、ふつふつと燃えたぎっていた。 （こんな小さな農村で、一生朽ち果てろというのだろうか。おれは、いやだ。いやだ） そこで、その代用教員生活も、一年程でやめて、上京した。 先生、この時、十九才。 父の善三郎と、当時ブラジル大使であった田付七太氏とが、同郷同窓の関係にあったので、父の紹介で、その田付家の書生になって勉強する心組みであった。 そして、その心組みの中には、大使の力にすがって南米方面に出て働きたいという希望も、そっと隠されていた。 上京して、書生になると、先生は明治大学の商科を選んで、そこに通った。ブラジル、メキシコ、アルゼンチン……。先生は、その夢に胸をふくらませて、勉強を続けた。 しかし、夢は、僅か二年で、もろくも崩れてしまった。厳父の死に遭ったばかりでなく、思いもかけない脚気を患ってしまったのである。しかも、相当の重症である。 やむなく、先生は、療養のため、郷里に引き上げた。 退屈で、若い命を包むには余りに刺激のない農村ではあったが、しかし、空気は清らかで、吹く風にも、流れる小川にも、静かな田園の平和があった。 そして、やがて、脚気も全快した。 しかし、一度崩れた夢は、もう再びはふくれ上がって来ない。先生は、あきらめた。 （おれは一生、サラリーマンで終るのだろうか。いやなことだ。だが、仕方がない） 先生は下関の図書館に口を見つけて、その雇人となった。 本が読めるのは嬉しかった。本の中で暮らしているのだから、読もうと思えば、どんな本でも手近にあった。 けれども、心は慰まなかった。この生活を愉しいとは思えなかった。 （本の虫。紙虫。おれは、月給の虫か） 先生は、自ら嘲って、早くこんな毎日から足を洗いたいものだと考えた。 図書館づとめは、二年でやめた。 三 先生のいとこが、久原鉱業の重役の夫人になっていた。 その縁で図書館をやめた先生は、久原鉱業へ入ったが、同県の先輩で、当時羽振りのよかった山田某に見込まれて、まもなく、大同電力へ移った。そして、名古屋へ出た。二十二才の時であった。 仕事に夢はなかったが、せっせと働いた。 それから三年たって、二十五才の時、先生は、この土地の大きな綿布問屋の娘である暉世子さんと結婚した。 「結婚式の始まる三十分前に婚姻届を出すようにするから、そのつもりで実印を用意して来なさい」 初めからそういう先生であった。 当時の名古屋では、子供が出来て初めて籍を入れるというのが普通のやり方であった。だが、何事でも几帳面でなければ承知できない先生であった。 さて、式はとどこおりなく済み、東照宮社務所で披露の宴が開かれた。 席上、先生は、花婿らしくもなく飲んだ。 花嫁は、ただはらはらしていた。 その時、花嫁の兄さんが、 「妹を頼みますよ。私のかわいい妹ですからね。本当にいい妹ですよ」と、血を分けた妹の将来を頼んだ。 それを聞くと、先生は、大きな目を更に大きくして、義兄となったその人をにらみつけた。 「いい妹、いい妹と、そんなに嫁にやるのが惜〔し〕いなら、さっさと連れて帰れ」 先生の声が大きかったので、まわりの者はなにごとかといぶかった。 ちょっと座が白けた。 先生は、そんなことには頓着なく、飲んでいた。 披露の宴の席上、先生はどうしてそんなに酔いたいのだろうか。それには理由があった。 息子の嫁を迎えるのに、暉世子さんではと、母親が反対の態度をとっていた。式にも出て来てくれなかった。 先生には、それが面白くなかった。面白くないというよりは、寂しくて、やりきれない思いであった。 そこへ酒が入った。先生は、花婿らしくもなく飲んだ。これでいいのだと思い、これからの女房教育が大変だとも思っていた。 その晩、家へ帰った先生は、厳かな顔で新妻に言い渡した。 「あしたからは絶対に名古屋弁をつかってはならぬ。紅白粉をつけてはならぬ。留守は責任をもって守ってもらわなければならぬ」 この三つの命令のうち、あとの二つはともかくとして、最初の一カ条――「名古屋弁を使うことも、まかりならぬ」は暉世子夫人にとって到底自信の持てないものであった。不意に口に出る名古屋弁をも許さないというのであろうか。 名古屋に生まれ、名古屋で育った女にとって、明日から絶対に名古屋弁を使ってはならないと言われることは、無理を要求されているようなものである。悪く考えれば、できないことをやれといういじのわるい脅迫ではないかとさえ思った。 しかし先生の要求は至上命令である。 「はい。かならずそういたします」 式服を脱いだばかりの新妻は、覚悟をきめて、そう答えた。答えなければならない厳しい空気がそこにあった。 翌日から、夫人はそれを実行した。 名古屋弁が出そうになると、咽喉のところまででその禁制の言葉を呑み込み、改めて標準語に直して、それからやっと物が言えるのであった。 それだけではない。 先生は、さっそく家計簿をつけるように命じた。命じたばかりではない。毎晩、その日の家計簿を点検して、これでよしという判を捺さなければ寝なかった。夫人も悪びれはしなかった。それならばそれで完璧な家計簿を見てもらおうと決意し、商業学校で習得した腕にものを言わせて、丹念に記帳し続けた。 一カ月たった。 「うん。これでよし」と先生は、満足そうに言った。 そしてそれからは、点検はもちろん、家計に関することは一切、妻にまかせてしまった。 当時、先生の俸給は八十五円で、家賃は二十五円であった。 四 大同電力でサラリーマン生活を続けていた先生は、再び、山田某に勧められて、東京神田神保町にあったフォード自動車会社の代理店のセールスマンになった。そして来る日も来る日も、自動車の売り込みに駆けずりまわった。 しかし、セールスマンは、もともと先生の性格には合わない。勤めたからには一生懸命やろうと思い、またその通り一生懸命やるのであったが、しかし性分に合わないものはどうにも仕方なく、胸の奥にはいつも穴のようなものがぽっかりと口をあけていた。 「ぼくはとうとう雲助になり下がってしまった」と先生は笑って自分にも言い、友人にも言った。その笑いは、青梅のようにすっぱい笑いであった。 セールスマン。 普通の人なら、それほど自嘲しなくてもいい仕事であるが、いい意味にも悪い意味にも潔癖すぎる先生にとっては、口八丁、手八丁で品物を売り込むというその仕事が恥ずかしくてならないのであった。自分がまるで箱根山中で酒代をねだる雲助のような境涯に堕ちてしまったように思われ、いつもいらいらしていた。 そういう先生を見、はじめフォード自動車会社代理店に入れた山田某も、溜息をついて言った。 「中島君、君は結局、坊主か牧師になるほうがいいかも知れないね」 事実、先生の心の底には、何か宗教的なものが芽生えつつあった。しかし、それは一つの星が出来上がる前のもやもやした雲のようなもので、自分でもその本体が掴めず、ただひとりでいら立っていた。 しかし、とにかく働かねばならない。 働かねば食べていけない。 そして、疲れて、妻の待つ麹町土手三番町の家に帰って来るのであった。 結婚四年目、ここで長女の三保子さんが生まれた。 仕事は面白くなかったが、初めての赤児だけに先生の喜びも大きく、気分的にも明るくなったとみえて、こんな冗談を言った。 「暉世子も辰年だし、三保子も辰年だ。ぼやぼやしていると、おれは竜にやられてしまうぞ」 先生も、もう三十才である。 本当の心の平和がほしい。落ちつきたい。 しかし、外面はとにかく、先生の胸の中にはまだもやもやしたものがあった。いつまでも十を三で割っているような、そんないらだたしさもあった。明るくはなったというものの、それは雲の多い日の空に似ていた。先生は、可愛い赤児を膝に乗せながらも、被害妄想者のように、自分で自分をいじめた。 （これでいいのか、これで） （この生活で満足しろというのか） 先生は、唇を噛むようにして、じっと考え込んでしまうのであった。 やがて、先生は、フォード自動車から、ブリジストンタイヤに転じて、一家の住いは大阪に移った。 その大阪支店で先生を待っていたものは、課長の椅子であった。 しかし、その椅子も、先生には坐り心地のいいものではなかった。 なるほど、セールスマンという肩書きはなくなり、埃をかぶって歩きまわる日々のかわりに、椅子に腰かけて判を捺す生活が主となったかも知れない。だが、そのどちらも先生には同じようにつまらなかった。 （自動車を売り込むことも、そのタイヤだけを売り込むことも、やはり雲助根性を必要とするのだ。これが俺の仕事だろうか。これを仕事としなければならないのだろうか） 先生は、社員たちが出て行った昼休みの事務室で、ほろ苦い思いを噛みしめた。 しかし、仕事はつまらないが、先生は自分というものを信じていた。いまに見ていろ。そういう気持ちがあった。 だから、家へ帰ると、先生は夫人に威張って言った。 「おれは日本一の婿殿だぞ」 新婚の翌年の正月であった。 先生夫妻は、婦人の実家へ年賀に行った。 綿布問屋であるから、そこには大勢の店員がいる。 夫人は、誘われるままに店員たちの仲間に入って歌留多をとった。 それを見て、先生は怒った。 「おれの女房なら、女房らしく、もっと威厳をもつんだ。雇人といっしょになって歌留多をとるなんて、なんという仕儀だ」 怒った先生は、そのままぷいと帰ってしまった。 その翌日、夫人は、こんなむずかしい良人と、今後どうやって行ったらいいだろうと真剣に悩んだ挙句、台所へ行って、飲めない酒をコップに一杯飲んだ。そうでもしなければやりきれなかった。 そして、ふらふらと外へ出た。 「まだおまえはお嬢さんのつもりでいるのか。何もおれが好き好んで貰ったのじゃないんだ。いやなら、いつでも出て行け」 さっき、そう怒鳴った先生も、婦人の姿が見えなくなると、さすがにあわてた。 すぐ、あとから追いかけて行った。 「おれは日本一の婿殿だぞ」という自慢は、決していいかげんのものではない。先生は真実そう自負していた。だから、家では威張っていた。 この大阪の家で、長男の誠八郎さんが生まれた。 五 しかし、誤解を受けないように、セールスマン時代の先生について、これだけは付け加えておきたい。先生は、負けることが嫌いであった。なにをしても一番にならなければ承知できないというタチであった。セールスマン時代といえども、この意地と気魄とで貫き通した。 後年、先生は、弟子たちに話した。 「よく切れる男というので、営業不振に陥っている支社を立て直すために転任させられたことがある。そこで私は、どうして品物が売れないのか、それを研究するために六カ月なにもしないで遊んでいた。少なくとも、第三者にはそう見えただろう。そのため、私は社内で大変な非難を受けた。しかし、その六カ月のあいだに、一つの発見をした。それは、どのセールスマンも、運転手との取引にかかりきりになっているので、うまく成績が上がらないということだ。それがわかった。そこで私は、運転手ではなく、自動車の持ち主と直接取引きすることにした。そのため、今まではゼロ、ゼロが続いていた売上げも、年末には同僚を追い越してしまった。このことが刺激となって、支社の営業成績は大変よくなった」 先生は、決して、自嘲の中にだけ生きていたのではなかったのである。 それどころか、やるだけは十分にやった上で、更に遠い一つの星――それがどういうものであるかは先生自身にもよくわからなかったが、とにかく遠くの空に光っている一つの星にあこがれ、それへの道を目指していたのであった。 六 いよいよ先生の脱皮の時が到来する。 「おれには、やらなければならない仕事がある。それがなんであるかは、まだわからない。だが、すくなくとも商売ではないはずだ」 自分自身に、そう言いきかせるようにしてして、先生はブリジストンタイヤを辞めた。 そして、未知の洞窟を探る探検家の勇気と、しかしやっぱりもやもやとしたものとをもって、大阪から再び東京へ出た。 親子四人のねぐらとして、中野の鷺の宮に小さな家を買った。四百五十円であった。 ある日、気がついてみると、やっと誕生日を迎えたばかりの男の子の右手の親指に、なにかぽつんとできている。 しかし、たいしたことはあるまいと思い、そのままにしておいたところ、それが脹れ出して来た。脹れは、日ましに大きくなる。用事は、痛たそうに泣き続ける。 近所の医者に連れて行った。 親指のさきを診察した医者は、首をかしげて、これは自分の手ではどうにもできないと言う。 そこで、水道橋にある一流の医者のところへ行った。 一目見るなり、その医者は、 「これはひどい。すぐ切断しなければ、手首まで拡がってしまう」と言った。 先生は、青くなった。この小さな可愛い指の一本を、切り落とさなければならないとは！ 先生の頭は混乱した。しかし、どうにもしようがなかった。 「お願いします」 先生は、目をつぶって、慄える声で、それだけをやっと言った。 医者は、用意が済むと、赤児の右手の親指を、そのまんなかの節のところから切断してしまった。 （ああ、とうとうこの児は片輪になってしまった） 先生と夫人とは、なんにも知らずに眠っている幼児のそばで、幾度か嘆息した。深い沼の底に引きずり込まれるような気持ちであった。 ところが、その手術の晩、こんどは三つになる三保子ちゃんが急に熱を出した。 それもただの熱ではない。四十度の高熱である。 あわてて医者を呼ぶと、疫痢だと言う。 打ち続く打撃に、先生夫妻は、ただオロオロするばかりだった。 「この子が死ぬようなことがあったら、おれも死ぬ」 先生は、そんなことも口走った。 その時、先生の友人の一人が訪ねて来た。 子供の病気のことを話すと、 「麹町にふしぎなことをする先生がいる。正木という名の先生だ。どんな病気でも治すことができるそうだ」 「誰からそんなことを聞いた」 「いや、実は昨夜、その麹町で講話会があった。ぼくはそれを聞きに行ったのだ。話の内容を一口で言えば、まあ心霊的治療法とでも言うもので、薬も何も使わずに、どんな病気でも治せるというのだ。ためしに、正木という人に頼んでみたらどうか」 「それだけでは、どうも信用できないな」 先生は、ニベもなく言った。 しかしそうは言ったものの、今は藁をも掴みたい必死の気持ちである。 うそか、ほんとうか。 とにかく、その治療法を受けてみよう。 そう決心すると、先生は、 「では、頼みに行って来よう」と友人の手を堅く握って言った。 宙を飛ぶ思いで麹町の家へ駆けつけ、正木という人に会って、子供の病状を話すと、 「では、すぐ行きましょう」と言う。 あまり簡単に引き受けてくれたので、先生は却って不安になった。 （この先生が、ほんとうに美保子の病気を治してくれるのだろうか） その人と連れ立って帰る道で、先生の心はまだ半信半疑であった。 家へ着くと、正木氏は妙なことを始めた。 病児の胸に扇子をかざして、じっと何かを念じているようであった。あとで、先生は、扇子をつかう方法は大本教の方式によるものだということを知った。しかし、その時は、ふしぎなことをするものだと思った。 長いあいだ、正木氏は、そうしている。 （いったい、これはどういうことなのか） 先生は、そのふしぎな所作に、目を見張っていた。 そのうちに、ぐったりとしている病児の頬に赤味がさして来た。どんよりとしていた目にも光が現われて来た。 「お水……お水、ちょうだい」 幼児は、枕もとの両親に、はっきりとそう言う。 水を飲ませると、 「おいちい、おいちい」と言う。 先生は、びっくりした。夫人も驚いている。 （これは治るぞ） なにがなんだかわからないが、ともかく病児が元気を取り戻したことを、今はっきりとこの目で見て、先生は、泣きたいような嬉しさで、ただ驚いていた。 それから一週間、病魔は完全に退散した。 七 正木氏の治療によって、愛児の病気が治った。この霊験あらたかな事実を、自分の目で見た。その厳粛な事実を前にして、先生は魂の底からゆすぶられるような感動を覚えた。 （これは、ただごとではない。とにかく、ただごとではない） 先生は、正木氏が師と仰ぐ大先生に会ってみたいと思った。いや、会わなければならないと思った。 その大先生は、岡田茂吉といって、大本教の幹部であり、信仰的治療法を世にひろめるため日夜苦闘しているということ、その治療法は単なる病気なおしではなくて、言わば救世済民の理想を濃縮させたものであることを、先生は正木氏から聞いていた。 （どんな風貌の人だろうか） そう思っても、胸が痛んだ。 とうとう、その日が来た。 すっかり健康になった美保子ちゃんを連れて、先生は大森の大先生と呼ばれている人を訪ねた。 もちろん、御礼を言いたかったからであるが、そのことばかりではなかった。世にも不思議な治療法の秘密が知りたかった。 だから、出かける前に、先生は婦人に言った。 「一流といわれる医者が匙を投げた子供の病気が、薬一つ使わず、ただ扇子をかざしただけで治ったのだ。おれは、その秘密を徹底的に究明してくる」 こうして、はじめて、先生は岡田茂吉という大先生に会った。 痩せて、小柄な、別にどうということもない中年の男であった。ただ、耳がいやに大きく、目がこわいほど鋭い。相手の心の奥を見通すような目である。 しかし、いろいろ話を聞いているうちに、先生の心はだんだんと軽くなって行くのであった。目に見えない綱で、今まで自分で自分をきりきりと縛っていた、その息苦しさから解放されて行く喜びが、酔いのように湧いて来た。 一時間ほどのあいだに、先生は完全にその人物に魅了されてしまった。 （これは、確かにただごとではない。いままで、自分がぼんやりと考えていたことを、この大先生ははっきりさせてくれるにちがいない。しかも、ことは急を要するのだ、ぐずぐずしてはいられない） 「私を弟子にしてください」 先生は思い切って、そう言った。その顔には必死なものが現われている。 この初対面の男の胸の中に、今何が起りつつあるかを見抜いたのであろう、大先生は、 「よし、してやる」 即座に、そう答えた。 こうして、後年の世界救世教教祖と、その忠実な弟子との結びつきは、一人の子供の病気という機縁によって、ここに実現したのであった。 思えば、東京大鋸（おおのこ）町に住む岡田茂吉という少年が、生来多病の身に二年前の肋膜炎が再発し、美術家への夢も空しく、十七才の春をひたすら斗病生活に明け暮していたその時に、先生は本州の西のはずれで生れている。 そして、それから幾十年の後、先生がその教祖のよき片腕となって、今日の教団の礎を築いたということは、まことに深い因縁と言わねばならない。 けれども、あらゆる人間関係において、そしてその共同の仕事において、神は常にこうした出会いを計画しているのである。 人が偶然と思うようなことの中にも、神の意志は、ちゃんと厳密に計量されている。神は、ただ、その人の決断を待っているのである。 しかも、その決断は、今すぐでなければならない。明日ではいけないのである。 「弟子にしてください」 「よし、弟子にしてやる」 この言葉に感激した先生は、胸をわくわくさせて家へ戻ると、早速準備を整え、翌日から大先生の家に泊まり込んだ。 後日、大本教のお筆先を暗記するため、それを書いた紙を天井一面に貼り、寝ながら覚えるという方法を試みた先生。 よく覚えられないと、自分の頭を拳固で殴って、「この馬鹿野郎！」と怒鳴ったりするので、夫人から気が狂ったのではないかと思われたという先生。 一度やろうと決心したら、なんでも徹底的にやらなければ気の済まない先生。 そういう先生であるから、朝から晩まで、時には晩から明け方まで、なにもかも忘れて、この新しい治療法の奥儀と取組んだ。 そして、泊り込んで七日目。大先生がいつも説かれる霊主体従の法則を、それこそ頭脳でなく、全人格で確信することが出来た。 もともと先生は、個性が強く、強情であった。 見ずして信ずることが出来れば幸いだが、先生は、そういう部類の人ではない。疑うことにおいても、人並み以上に敏感であるから、言葉や理屈だけで、おいそれと信ずる人ではない。こういう人は、見ることが必要である。見なければ、信じようとはしない。 ところが、自分で治療しているあいだに、奇蹟は次から次へと起った。 いやでも、先生は、それを見た。 病気は霊の曇り―― 霊主体従の法則を信ずるよりほかはない。 その法則を否定するためには、毎日のように起る奇蹟を否定しなければならない。 その奇蹟は、絶対に否定できない。何故なら、自分はこの二つの目で、昨日も今日も、それを見ているのだから。 このときから先生は、これまでの人生観を脱皮した。百八十度の転換が行われた。 自分の心の中の革命に、驚きと喜びとをもって、先生はつぶやくのであった。 （私はもうない。大先生の弟子としての自分があるだけだ。大先生がなければ、この私もなくなる） しかし、奇蹟は、更にもう一つの奇蹟を現した。 それは、右手の親指のまんなかの節から切断した赤児のその指が、その後、だんだんと伸びて来て、しかもちゃんと爪まで生えたことである。今では誰が見ても、これが昔、無残にも切り落とされた指だとは気がつかない。 ――指も生える。 八 大先生は大本教を信じている。大先生の信ずるものは、自分もまた信じなければならない。 「綾部へ行って来る」 そう夫人に言って、丹波へ出かけて行った先生は、大本教の本部で、一週間、その教理を学んだ。学ぶといっても、先生のやり方は脳細胞で吸収するのではない。いつの場合も、全身の毛穴からたっぷり吸い込むというやり方である。知識ではなく、知恵である。 家へ戻ってきた先生は、首から「おやしろ」（御守）をかけていた。 そして、玄関へ帰るなり、いきなり出迎えた夫人に、 「おまえも綾部へ行くんだ」と言う。 それは、相談ではない。命令である。 「行けとおっしゃっても、小さい子供が二人もあっては……」 夫人が即答しかねていると、雷が落ちた。 「行けと言ったら行って来い。子供をかかえてでも、その気になれば行けるんだ。行って来い」 仕方なく、夫人は、 「はい。参ります」と答えた。しかし、そうは言っても、幼い二人の子供をもつ身で、すぐに出かけることは出来ない。 いろいろ準備して、夫人が丹波へ出かけたのは、それから半カ月たってからであった。 そして、信者となって帰って来た。先生は満足そうに、自分で自分に言った。 （これでよし） 大体、先生という人は、冷静な面もあったが、それ以上に激情的な人であった。それだけに、信仰の面でも、「総てか、無か」でなければ承知できない。それは人生観でもあったが、又先生の性格でもあった。 先生は、大本教のお筆先を半紙に書いて天井に貼って置いたということは前に書いたが、ある時、そのうちの一番肝腎な文句と思うところをちぎって、それを呑み込んでしまった。頭へ入れるだけでは我慢できなくなったのである。腹の中へ入れてしまわなければ、安心が出来なかったのであった。 先生は、そういう人であった。だから、文字通り不眠不休の勉強で、そばで見ている夫人の方がやり切れなくなる。 （これが、信仰地獄というものだろうか） 夫人は本当にそう思わずにはいられない時もあった。 婦人の実家では、 「中島は気違いになった。あんな亭主と一緒にいたら、暉世子は今にどうかなってしまう」と騒いだ。 信仰に入るにも、二つの道がある。一段一段階段を上って行くようにして頂上に至る人と、エレベーターのように一直線に上って、ついにその最高峰に達する人と……。 先生は、その後者であった。 舞台は、一瞬にして変った。 その人を見つけるまでは、先生は、「さまよえる模索者」であった。 その人とは、言うまでもなく、大先生である。 「大先生は、私が発見した」と、先生は自分に言い、弟子にも言った。 なるほど、そうかも知れない。しかし、先生を発見したのも、大先生であった。それは、二つの遊星の上の天文学者が、それぞれの望遠鏡をもって、おたがいを同時に発見したというのが本当であろう。 それまでの先生は、暗中模索者として、いつも何かを追っていた。その何かは自分にもよくはわからなかったが。ただ漫然と、「自分もつくられ、人もつくる道」――そういうものが、自分を持っている。早くその道へ出たいものだと思っていた。 けれども、その道の入り口もわからなかった。何処から入っていいのかわからなかった。 先生は、悩み、考え、いらいらしていた。そして、それは、結婚してからも続いた。虹の橋を遠くに認めていながら、さて何処から登って行ったらいいのかわからないで泣きそうな目をしている子供のように、先生は、途方に暮れ、頭の毛を掻きむしっていた。 その先生が、大先生を発見した。 先生の前に、ぱっと光がさして来た。 先生の人間が変り、人生が変った。先生は、この時新しく生れた赤児となった。この赤児は、母の如く大先生を慕い、信じた。そして、この献身は、生涯変ることがなかった。 この献身は、焼身といってもいいのであろう。自分のからだを火に焼いて、仏等を供養し、衆生にも恵み与える列行――これを焼身供養と言うが、先生は、焼身して大先生につかえた。そこにはもう、いささかの迷いも、疑いもなかった。 それは迷いに迷い、疑いに疑いを重ねていた親鸞が、ある日、法然に会い、わが師が地獄に堕ちるなら、自分も喜んで地獄に堕ちようと思った。あの絶対的信従に似ている。 晩年、先生は、こう書いた。 「神を説明する言葉は、実に多い。神は光なり。神は愛なり。あるいは、幽現界の根本、無始無終が神だとも説明している。しかし、神を本当にわかっている者は、極めてすくない。わからないでも、わかったつもりでいる。そういう者が多い。ではどういう人が、神を本当にわかった人と言えるだろうか。それは、神は、どんな優れた人間の知恵でも分析したり、解釈したり出来るものではないということを、そのことを知っている人である。神は、体験を通してでなければ、わかって来ない。いくら頭をひねってみても、理屈ではわからない。理屈以上の奇蹟を体験することによって、次第に、神がわかって来る」 同じく晩年、先生は、こうも書いた。 「そもそも、人間意欲の中で、一番魅力を感ずることは、神秘を探り当てようという願いである。例えば、信仰に熱を増すのは、神秘を探求したいという意欲のあらわれで、一つの神秘を探り当てると、更に次の神秘を探求したくなる。知れば知るほど、いよいよその奥を探り当てたくなる。ここに、信仰の魅力があり、妙味がある。そして、奇蹟とは神秘の表現化したものであるから、神秘を探求すればするほど、奇蹟を体験することになる。信仰に熱を増すのも、言うならば、この奇蹟を多く戴きたいからである。だから、神秘を探り当てたいという願いの強い人ほど多くの奇蹟を戴くことになり、そこで益々信仰に熱を増すということになる」 「宗教と恋愛と、相通ずるものがある。宗教の神秘にあこがれる点と、恋人にあこがれる点とは、よく似ている。ただ、ちがうところは、恋愛の終局点が結婚であり、結婚すると、大抵はその新鮮な魅力を失って来るのに対して、神への恋愛――即ち、宗教は永久的のものであって、神秘を探求すればするほど、魅力はますます強くなり、妙味も増して来るものである。新鮮な魅力を失うどころか、探れば探るほど、いよいよ魅力は大きくなる」 その神――宇宙の中心である真神が、衆生済度の悲願をもって神の座を降り、仏となって下生されたその観世音菩薩こそ、先生の神であった。そして、その信仰は、死に至るまで、いささかの動揺も来たさなかった。 九 先生にとって、大先生はただ一人の人であった。大先生があってこそのわが身であり、わが身のためのわが身などというものはなくなった。 だから、あらゆる物も、大先生の物であった。 何か買いものをすると、 「大先生は、これをもう召し上がったかしら」と思い、菓子一つにも心をくばった。 大先生の着ないようなものは、先生も着なかった。 太平洋戦争がはじまって、甘い菓子もなかなか手に入らなくなると、先生は苦労してその券を手に入れ、新宿の中村屋の前に行列して、それを買うのである。そして、子供のように喜んで、大先生の家へ届に行った。 郷里の家を売って二千五百円という金が入ったことがある。その時、先生は、それをそっくり大先生の前に差し出し、 「神様の御用のために使ってください」と嬉しそうに言った。 余裕が出来てからのことではない。殆どどん底の貧乏生活の中にあって、そうしなければいられないのである。 そして、家には一銭の金のない日も、 「寝るほどらくはないね」などと笑って、先生は昼寝をしていた。 昭和八年十二月二十三日。 先生は、大森へ行って、大先生の誕生日をお祝いした。 その日、先生は、魚屋に鯛を頼んでおいたのだったが、皇太子殿下がお生まれになったその佳き日とあって、おいそれと鯛が手に入らなかった。 それでもようやく大きな鯛が見つかって、それを持って行くことができた。 師弟水入らずのこの祝いの宴を、大先生はどんなに喜んだことでだろう。 このことが例となって、それからは毎年、弟子たちが集って大先生の誕生日を祝うことになった。 「忠誠」 先生が、大先生に仕える純愛の心は、他の言葉で言うならば、この二字が一番ぴったりしている。 それは、まことに、忠誠であった。最も純粋な意味においての忠誠であった。 この忠誠が、先生の火のような信念となった。おのが人生の自信となった。 先生は、他のことはともかく、大先生から与えられた信仰については、誰にも指一本ささせなかった。さすものは、斬って捨てるの意気があった。 だから、弟子たちとの議論においても、先生は、みじんの容赦もしなかった。相手に手も足も出させない激しさがあった。一歩も譲らなかった。 「あの時分、私は、先生はなんて苛酷な人だろうと、恨めしくさえ思いました」 後年、こう述懐している弟子もある。 これも、先生の忠誠のあらわれであった。君の馬前で打死することを本望とする家来のような忠誠心を、大先生に対して、一生変らず持ち続けたればこそ、大先生の教えられる道についてくどくどと批判がましいことは言わせなかった。 「素直でなければいけない。ハイという返事と、立ち上がるのとが、同時でなければいけない」 先生は、よくこう言ったが、大先生に対しては、先生はすぐ立ち上った。どんなことを言われても、ハイと返事をした。返事と同時に、もう身を起していた。 十 中野の鷺の宮から、阿佐ヶ谷へ引っ越した。 生活は苦しかった。先生の収入は皆無といってよかった。 夫人は、大本教の機関紙「東方の光」を売り歩いた。妊娠しても、家にじっと坐っていることは許されなかった。生活がそれを許してくれなかったというよりも、先生が許さなかった。 当時、「東方の光」は一部二銭で、売り上げの半分は大先生に届ける。だから、どんなことがあっても一日八十部は売らなければ暮して行けない。 一日八十部で、手取りが八十銭、一ヵ月に二十四円。 どんなに物価が安く、金の値打ちのあった当時でも、親子四人が二十四円で生活して行くのは、並大抵の苦労ではなかった。 おかずを買う金がなくて、野原の土筆を摘んで来て食べなければならない日もあった。 そういう苦しい暮らしの中でも、先生の夫人に対する教育はきびしかった。「一日為さざれば一日食らわず」という厳しい人生観を叩き込もうとして懸命であった。 夫人の返事が、ちょっとでも気に入らないと、 「なんだ、その返事のしようは」と叱りつけられる。 腰の上げ方がおそいと、 「なにをぐずぐずしているのか」 夫人は、まるで独楽のようにきりきり舞いをし、つむじ風のように今日はこっち、明日はあっちと飛び廻った。その過労から目を悪くした。それでも、先生は、なおもつぶやいた。 （おれは、暉世子を仕込んでいるのだ） そのくらいであるから、子供のしつけにも厳格であった。 後年、長女の三保子さんは、こう言っている。 「ずいぶん厳しい父でした。けれど、筋の通った叱り方をされるので、あと味は悪くありませんでした。とは言っても、叱られている最中は、そんなに言わなくてもいいのにと、恨めしく思いました。でも、今日になってみると、父のしつけの厳しさは、あれはあれでよかったのだと、つくづく有難く思います。それは、父の厳格さの底にある涙もろさ、それがわかったからです。本当は、父は涙もろい人情家だったのです」 これは、良人としての先生についても、そのまま通用する。 「なんて気のきかないやつなのだ」 そう言って、二階から下りて来て、やにわに夫人に拳をふり上げるような、ぴりぴりした神経をもっていた。しかし、先生はそのあとですぐ後悔した。後悔して涙ぐんでいることもあった。 それなのに、昂ぶって来ると、自分で自分がどうしようもなくなり、又怒鳴りちらすのである。そして、又後悔するのであった。 会社を辞める時に貰った退職金も、とっくになくなってしまっていた。 相変らず生活は苦しかった。 家主は、おためごかしに、こんなことを言う。 「金が欲しかったら、電気治療をやりなさい。あれなら、患者は来るよ」 先生は、黙っていた。余計なことを言うなという顔をしていた。 （おれはただの治療屋ではないのだ。そんなものにはなりたくない。又、なろうと思っても、なれるおれの性格ではない） 家主は、そういう先生を見つめて、 （なんて融通のきかない男だろう）とあきらめている。 ある時、この家主の勧めた電気治療のことを、大先生に話した。 大先生は、気軽に、 「両方やれ。両方やったらいい」と言った。 しかし、そういう器用なことの出来る性格ではない。この話は、それでおしまいになったのであるが、先生の火のような理想主義は、ついに大本教の某氏の信仰観と正面衝突し、とどのつまり先生は、敢然として教団そのものと袂を分ってしまった。 それは昭和八年のことであった。 その翌年、大先生も、大本教の幹部の地位を退き、麹町半蔵門に信仰的指圧療法の治療所を開いた。時に大先生は満五十二才。先生は三十五才であった。 こういう貧乏時代がそれからも長く続いたが、どんなに困った時でも、先生は泣きごとを嫌った。だから、夫人は愚痴をこぼすことが出来なかった。愚痴ばかりではない、金のことはなんにも口に出せなかった。夫人は歯を食いしばって、黙っていなければならなかった。 「空飛ぶ鳥を見ろ。なんの貯えもなく生きている。まして万物の霊長たる人間が食べられないということはない」 先生は、よくそれを夫人に言った。そして、金など通用しない国にでも暮らしているような顔をしていた。 先生は、借金も大嫌いであった。 だから、夫人は、急場をしのぐための僅かの金も借りることが出来なかった。見つかれば怒られるにきまっているから。 けれども、どうにも仕方なくなって、生活の金を借りたこともないではない。それを知って、先生はうるさく夫人に言う。 「すぐ返せ。すぐ返すんだぞ」 夫人は、嫁入りする時に持ってきたものを片っぱしから売って来た。もう売るものもない。 「もう、すっかりなくしてしまいました」と夫人は、ある時、却ってさっぱりしたとでもいうような顔をして言った。 「おれだって、単衣を袷（あわせ）に直したものを着ているんだ。それでも結構しあわせなんだ」 そう言って、先生は笑った。 十一 この家で、先生夫妻は、まる半年、ひどいカイセンを患った。 子供はいるし、手はかかるし、夫婦で床に就いていたのでは、毎日の炊事も思うにまかせない。派出婦を雇えば、洗濯物が臭いといって、すぐ帰ってしまう。しまいには、誰も手伝いに来てくれなくなった。 からだじゅうぐるぐるに包帯を巻いた先生は、生き地獄のような苦しみの中でも、なんにも言わずに寝ていた。 弟子たちが来ると、そういう体を見せないように、顎のところまで蒲団をかぶっていた。 月並祭の日になると、先生は、二階の六畳に寝たまま、物干台に座蒲団を並べさせ、そこに三十人位の信者坐らせて、蒲団の中から講話した。一時間も話した。 夫人は「一時的で結構ですから、私のカイセンを先きに治してください」と祈った。二人が寝ていては、子供が生きて行けない。 その祈りがかなって、夫人は先生より一足さきに治った。 しかし、数年たって、夫人は二度目のカイセンに罹った。 「これでいい。一時的でいいから治してくださいと祈ったのだから、これが当たり前なのだ」 夫人は、指の中程まで包帯を巻いたその不自由な手で大先生から頼まれた毛布の腹巻を編んだ。せめてものご恩返しと思って、せっせと編み続けた。 その姿を見て、先生は涙ぐむ。 先生にとって、大先生はこの世にかけがえのない、たった一人の人である。その人のために、妻が全身の痒みをこらえて、腹巻をつくっている。 先生は、心の中で、 （ありがとう）と言った。 十二 昭和十年一月一日。 大日本観音教会の発会式が、麹町半蔵門の治療所で挙げられた。 大先生の家も、大森から玉川上野毛（かみのげ）に移って、教会本部となった。 その頃には、先生の家も、阿佐ヶ谷から再び中野へ――しかし、今度は本町通り三丁目に移っていた。 翌十一年夏、五十五才の大先生は、埼玉の大宮警察署から呼び出され、ついで玉川署に留置されるという事件が起った。療術行為はまかりならぬというのである。 そして、十二年秋、治療はしてもいいが、宗教とからませて行うことはならぬというお達しがあって、大先生は表面上、宗教を離れて治療行為だけで立つことになった。 先生も、表面だけ宗教と関係のない単なる治療ということにして、それにふさわしい看板をかけた。 しかし、患者は、思うように来てくれなかった。一人も来ない日もあった。 そういう誰も来ない日は、先生は、果報は寝て待てとばかり、座敷に寝ころがっていた。その顔に、暗い影など微塵もなかった。自信満々という顔付であった。 さて、その翌年の昭和十三年、先生一家は同じ中野の一丁目へ引越した。 引越して一週間ほどたった日、先生は散髪に出かけた。 途中、ある寺の門前にさしかかると、八十ぐらいの老婆が、精も根も尽き果てたという格好で、じっとうずくまっている。 声をかけたが、返事も出来ない。ただ、拝むようにして、先生を見上げた。その目は、どろんとして、何かの病気を背負っている目である。 先生は、これはこのまま捨ててはおけないと思い、家へ連れて行こうと考えた。 考えるということと、おこなうということは、先生の場合、常に一つである。 先生は、その老婆をかかえるようにして、家へ戻った。 診察すると、喉頭結核だということがわかった。 それから、毎日、先生の治療が続けられた。 老婆のからだは、めきめきとよくなった。 すっかり全快した老婆は、 「なんとお礼を申してよいかわかりません。でも、私にはなんにも差し上げるものがありません」と涙を流して言った。 「お礼なんかいらないよ」 先生は、血色もよくなった老婆の顔を見て、嬉しそうに言った。 老婆は、幾度も頭を下げて、帰って行った。 そして、しばらくたったある日、一人の男が先生を訪ねて来た。 「あなたのことを、ある人から聞きました、私も信仰ということについては、いろいろと考えている者です。是非一度あなたにお会いしたくて来ました」と、その人は言った。 この人こそ誰あろう、後の日本五六七教会の渋井総三郎先生であった。 神は讃むべきかな。この時から、先生とその人の密接な、そして因縁の深い関係が結ばれたのである。 大先生はよくこう言った。 「中島は火、渋井は水。そして、中島は縦、渋井は横だ。この二人は、車の両輪なのだ。どっちも重要だ。どっち一つが欠けても、車は動かない。自分は、こういう立派な二人の人間を持つことができた。だから、安心して車の上に乗っていられる」 十三 昭和十四年九月六日。 次男の三六ちゃんが、数え六つの可愛い盛りで昇天した。 ひどい下痢だった。寿命というのだろうか。とうとうだめであった。 その時、夫人は三女の博子ちゃんを身ごもっていた。 長女三保子、長男誠八郎、そして、次男の三六ちゃん（三月六日に生れたので、大先生が三六と命名した）は天国へ。その下には、幼い春代ちゃんがいる。 子を失った悲しみの中で、身重の夫人は、 「あの子の身代りが、私のおなかの入っている。だから、男の子にちがいない」と僅かに自分を慰めていた。 しかし、生れたのは女の子であった。博子と名づけた。 三六ちゃんの身代りだと思ったおなかの子が、生れてみたら女の子であったという落胆で、夫人はノイローゼになった。 そのゆがんだ執着のためであろう。三女の博子ちゃんは、僅か一年足らずで他界してしまった。 一つの家で、相次いで、先生夫妻は二つの柩（ひつぎ）を出してしまった。暗い朝夕であった。 しかし、それからしばらくして、四女の光子ちゃんが生れ、光は再び訪れて来た。 そして、更にその後、昭和十九年七月、先生一家が熱海伊豆山へ疎開する時、夫人は七度目の赤児を身ごもっていた。 この赤児は、人々が空襲のサイレンにおびえて暮さなければならない戦時中にもかかわらず、十一月七日に無事に生れた。和子と名づけられた。 大先生は、 「二人亡くしたから、ちゃんとあとから二人頂けたじゃないか」と嬉しそうに言った。 しかし、これはあとの話であって、二人の子を亡くした先生の悲しみは大きかった。 その悲しみを慰めてくれるものは、ただ信仰だけであった。その先生が、自分に言う。 （生き変り、死に変り、人間の生命は、永遠に続く。死とは、衣替えをすることだ。大先生が、それを教えて呉れた。自分は、それを疑わない。どうして疑わないでいられるのだろう。もともとおれは、猜疑心の強い人間だ。人の言うことも、素直に聞けない頑くななところがある。そのおれが、大先生の言うことは、なんの疑いもなく信じられる。これは、自分にとって、大きなふしぎだ。これまで、そういう人にぶつかったことはなかった。一体これは、どういうことだろう。大先生に会ってから、おれの心というものはなくなったのだ。大先生の心がそのまま自分の心となってしまったのだ。既に、自分はない。大先生があるだけだ。こうなったおれが、大先生の一言一句をも疑うことの出来ないのは、当然過ぎるほど当然である。自分は、ただ、大先生を信ずる。死とは、衣替えだと聞かされたから、そう信ずる。高いところから、水が低いところに流れる。自分は、大先生の言う通りに、自然に、何処へでも流れていこう） 十四 Ｎさんは、復員して来て、ある人から、 「東京の中野に、えらい先生がいる。病気は、なんでも治して呉れる。大変な先生だ」という話を聞いた。 Ｎさんは、すこし胸を悪くしていた。 「君の病気なんか、二三回の治療で全快してしまう」とも言った。 （本当だろうか。嘘じゃないだろうか。しかし、この人はデタラメを言う人ではない） Ｎさんは、迷った。その話を信用して、すぐ訪ねて行くという気にはなれなかった。 しかし、自分の胸のことを考えると、じっとしてはいられなかった。 しまいには、矢も盾もたまらなくなって、Ｎさんは、昭和十七年十二月、神戸を立った。 列車の中で、いろいろと想像してみた。どんな先生だろうか、どんな家だろうかと思ってみた。 戦争は、まだ続いている。 自分は病気のため復員して来たが、いつまで不安な日が続くかわからない。 混み合う列車の隅でＮさんは、「中野の先生」だけを望みとして、じっと目をつぶっていた。 東京駅に着いて、それから中央線に乗って、ようやく目指す家を見つけた。 どんなに立派な構えかと思っていたら、小さな貸家建の家で、中島治療院と書いた白ペンキの看板が出ている。 玄関をあけてみたが、脱いだ下駄一つない。 （いくら朝の八時だと言って、これは少し静か過ぎる） いぶかりながら、Ｎさんは、案内を乞う。 家の人が出てきて、 「どうぞ」と言う。 上がってみると、やはり座敷には、誰もいない。手もち無沙汰で、じっと座っていた。 やがて、治療を受ける人が、だんだんとやってきた。 話に聞いた中島先生という人は、痩せて、背が高く、長い顔の目がいやに鋭い人だなと思った。 自分が一番早かったのだから、一番先に治療――それはなんでも掌をかざすだけだと聞いたが、その治療をして呉れると思ったのに、先生は、Ｎさんには目も呉れず、あとから来た患者の治療をはじめた。 この次だなと思っていると、又、あとから来た人を治療する。 患者は、あとから、あとからやって来る。先生は、Ｎさんの姿が目に入らないかのように、その人たちを治療し続けている。 いいかげん厭になった。 しかし、この先生が自分の胸を治して呉れるのだと思えば、帰ることも出来ない。じっと待っていた。 とうとう、午後の四時頃まで待たされた。 そして、ようやく自分の番になった。 「私は、朝の八時から来ているんですが……」とＮさんは、先生の前に坐って、恨みに似た気持ちでいった。 「君は教育を受ける人だろう。そのために来たのだろう。だから、一番あとにしたのだ」と先生は、にこりともしないで言った。 Ｎさんから、結核の病状を聞くと、先生は、 「深呼吸をしてみなさい」と言う。 Ｎさんは、息を吸って、出した。 「それだけ呼吸が出来るじゃないか。百パーセントの出し入れが出来なくなっても、八十パーセントの出し入れが出来れば、心配することはない。肺はたいして悪くない」 先生は、そう言ってＮさんのあちこちを中指で押してみている。 「心臓、腎臓、肝臓、胃――みんな悪い」 「いえ、それはたいしたことはないんです」 Ｎさんは、抗議するように言い切った。 「いや。大変悪い。肺よりも悪い。肺の方は、自覚症状があるだけ、まだいい」 先生の言い方には、権威があった。 Ｎさんは、ただ、 「はあ」とだけ言った。 二日目。 「ここに坐っていなさい」と先生がいった。 見ると、見台が置いてあって、その上に、五六百頁はあると思われる原稿が載せてある。 「これを読みなさい」と、又先生は命令するように言った。 一頁、一頁、読んで行った。 下手な字だなと思った。 いろいろなことが書いてあった。わかるところもあるが、わからないところも多い。 とにかく読めと言うから、読んだ。 全部読み終わるのに、満一日かかった。 「読みました」と言ったら、 「読んでもわからないところがあったろう、今、話してやってもいいが、やっぱりよくわからないだろう。だから、皆が来て、私にいろいろ質問するから、それを聞きなさい。気をつけて聞いていなければならないよ」と、先生はあっさりと行ってしまった。 Ｎさんは、ポカンと狐につままれたような顔をしていた。 十五 三日目。 「おまえは、黙っているが、質問することはないのか」と先生は催促するように言う。 そこで、Ｎさんは、善と悪との問題について、わからないところを訊いた。 「悪いことをすれば、霊が雲って、体も病気になる。善いことをしていれば、霊は浄められて、病気もない」 「では、絶対の善というものはあるものですか」 「ない」 「それでは、ただ苦しむだけではありませんか」 「絶対の善には到達できないが、それに近づくことは出来る」 「その理屈は、わかります」 「理屈ではだめだ。理屈でわかるものじゃない」 「では、どうすればいいのですか」 「一人でも人を救うことだ」 Ｎさんは、わかったような、わからないような気持ちになっていた。 毎日、一人で考えた。 それから幾日かたって、雨が降った。 雨の日は暇である。その日も、患者はまだ誰も来ていなかった。 「今日は暇だから、力を見せてやる。裸になれ」と先生は言った。 裸になって坐ると、十五分ぐらい浄霊をした。 「どうだ」 手を置いて、先生は言う。 「気持ちがいいです」 「肩がつまっているのだ。苦しいだろう」 そう言って、三十分ぐらいたってから、また浄霊をした。こんどは、五分ぐらいであった。 「どうだ」 先生は、また同じことを言った。 Ｎさんは、立ってみた。立った時の軽やかな感じに驚いた。 「恐れ入りました」とＮさんは、心から丁寧に頭を下げた。 「力とは、こういうものだ」 先生はどうだ、わかったろうというような顔をした。 「なぜ、こう軽くなるのでしょうか」 「もうしばらくすれば、又重くなる」 先生は、宣告するように言った」 （軽くも、重くも、自由に出来るのか） Ｎさんは、この時はじめて、霊能者というものは、こういう人のことなのだなと思った。 言うまでもなく、このＮさんは、その後、信者になった。助手になり、分会長になった。先生の片腕として、多くの人を救った。大先生が、あれは若いけれど、どうしてたいした者だと賞めていた。。 先生は、よく人を見た。見つめて、見つめた。そして、信ずるに足る相手だとわかると、なにもかも隠さなかった。信じた以上、とことんまで自分というものを見せるのが本当で、何も隠すものはないはずだ。そう思っていた。 ある地方の布教をまかせられた若い弟子が、 「私はその柄ではありませんから」と言うと、先生は、断乎として言った。 「まかせられる確信があるから、おまえにまかせるのだ。その柄があるか、ないかは、おまえより、おれが」知っている こういう先生であったから、Ｎさんの全部を見抜いて、その揺るぎない信念を知ると、恥ずかしいことも何も、あけすけに話した。 「おれだって、何も最初から弟子つくりに百パーセントの成功を収めたわけじゃない。そうだね、数えてみると、十一回も失敗している。おかげで、人を疑うことを覚えたよ。それだけ自分は、卑近な人間さ」 十六 「昭和十八年のはじめ頃、これまでの信者がどんどん脱落していったことがあった。そして、新しい信者は、すこしも出来ない。 「先生のやり方がきびしすぎるからだ」とひそひそ話をする弟子もいた。 治療だけを受けに来る人も、多くてせいぜい一日に十人程度になってしまった。 厳しいのは、信者に対してだけではなかった。 夫人も、助手として働いていたのであるが、ことごとに叱られた。へまをすると、いやという程怒鳴りつけられた。 治療に来る人が、 「あの二人は、夫婦じゃないね」 「そうさね、夫婦じゃないらしいね」 そういう話をするくらい、先生はぴりぴりしていた。 それでも、やめるわけには行かなかった。夫人は上から白衣を着て、患者の家を廻った。 患者がすくないのだから、当然、生活は苦しくなった。 しかし、先生は、自信たっぷりであった。 「男としてやり甲斐のある仕事を、おれは。見つけたのだ。これを逃したら、もう外には何もないのだ。おれは心から生き甲斐を感じているのだ。みていろ、今に」 先生は、胸を張って言った。 「世間の人が、わかって呉れなくてもいい。どんなに笑ってもいい。真理のために一生を捧げるのだ。それだけが、おれの生き甲斐だ。踏まれても、蹴られても、おれは本望だ」 先生は、こうも言っていた。 こういう時の先生の頬は、情熱で紅潮し目には涙がにじんでいるのであった。 そして、その年の暮れから、十九年にかけて、信者はぐんぐんふえて来た。一度脱落した者も、再び帰って来た。治療を受けに来る人も、一年目の倍以上、毎日二十人を越えた。当然、先生の身辺は忙がしくなった。 昭和十九年の九月であった。 東北のある農村へ、先生は教修に出かけることとなった。 その村の信者で、教修のお膳立てをする人は、せっかく先生が来られるのだから、どうしても受講者を三十人は集めなければならないと考えて、あっちこっち走りまわった。 そして、前の日までに、二十九人を集めることができた。 （あともう一人、それでないと、先生に叱られるかもしれない） そう思って、その人は､更に近所近辺を馳けまわった。 そして、やっと三十人にした。 教修が済んだその晩、泊まった世話人の家で、先生は、「野風呂に入ってみたい」と言う。 家人がわざわざ風呂桶を野天に運び出して、沸かした。 首までとっぷりつかりながら、先生は機嫌よかった。 （ああ、いい気持ちだなあ） 遠くで泣いているカッコウの声を聞きながら、先生は満足気であった。 （これがもし三十人集らずに、二十人や二十五人だったら、あの機嫌のいい顔は見られなかっただろう） その人は、やれやれという思いであった。 十七 Ｈさんは、その数日前からできていた左目の「物もらい」が脹れて来て、困っていた。 それはますます大きくなるし、痛みもひどく、医者に行って切開してもらうより仕方ないと思った。 しかし、Ｈさんは、ある女子大学の教師をしている。もともと右の目が弱視でめがねも殆ど用をなさないほどである。だから、左の目だけで暮らしているようなものであった。 今、医者へ行って切開してもらえば、必ず眼帯をかけられる。それも、こんなに凄い物もらいなのだから、一週間はおろか、二週間も眼帯をはずすことができないかも知れない。それでは、そのあいだは盲も同然になってしまう。 しかも、母親の病気のため、最近一ヵ月も休講してしまった。三学期に教えてしまわなければならない部分が、たくさん残っている。だからこれ以上、学校を休むわけには行かない。 その時、一ヵ月程前に、これもある大学の教授の夫人から、浄化療法という耳新しい治療法の話を聞いたことを思い出した。 その時、教授夫人は、 「オデキなどは、見ているうちに膿が出てしまうのよ」と言っていた。 全く半身〔信〕半疑の気持であった。迷っていた。 しかし、前の晩早く膿を出してしまおうと考えて、温湿布をして寝たのが祟って、朝起きてみると、顔の半分が脹れ上がり、われながら二目と見られない形相。しかも、痛みはいよいよ大きい。 Ｈさんは瞞されたと思って行ってみようと決心して、その先生を紹介してもらうために、教授夫人を訪ねた。 昭和十九年の一月のことである。 ところが、それが一の日で、当時、先生をはじめ天国会の幹部たちは、毎月その日に大先生のところに集ることになっていた。だから、中野の治療所は休みだとのことであった。 困った顔をしていると、教授夫人は、 「あなたが、そんなに困っていらっしゃるなら、私でもできるのよ。このあいだ、卒業したばかりの新米だけど、私でよかったらして上げます。そして、先生のところへは、あしたいらっしゃるといいわ」と言うのである。 信用は出来ないと思ったが、藁をも掴む気持で、Ｈさんは、その夫人の前に坐った。 十八 Ｈさんの前で、夫人は、かざした掌を、ひらひらと振っている。おかしなことをすると思って。四十分余り、神妙に坐っていた。 そして、首がだるくなった頃、 「今日は、これだけにしましょう」と夫人が言ったので、Ｈさんは、やれやれと思った。 帰って、その晩は、言われた通り温湿布も冷湿布もやめて、寝た。 とかく不眠症に悩まされ勝であった上に、その物もらいのために、なお更眠れなかったＨさんが、その夜は久しぶりでぐっすりと眠った。朝目が覚めた時は、いつにない気持のよさであった。 そればかりではない。目も頬も、脹れが殆ど引いていて、痛みもない。眼帯をそっと除いてみると、黄色い膿が大分出ている。 （きのうのアレがきいたのか、それとも時期が来て自然に膿が出たのだろうか） Ｈさんは、まだ半信半疑だった。しかし、とにかくふしぎであった。 その翌日紹介状を持って、中野の治療所へ出かけた。 もう少し立派な家かと思っていたら、あまりぱっとしない、小さな家であった。玄関には、幾足かの靴や下駄が、ごちゃごちゃと並んでいた。 Ｈさんは、おそるおそる暗い階段を上がって行った。 二階は、六畳二間つづきで、奥の部屋の正面に、先生らしい人が誰かを治療している。建物の割には、何となく気品のある人だと思いながら、座敷へ入って行くと、その先生らしい人が、顔を上げて、 「いらっしゃい」と言った。 大きな目の奥に光っているその目の鋭さに、Ｈさんは、ちょっと驚いた。 この人が中島という先生にちがいないと思った。これは他の誰でもないと、直感した。 先生は、掌をかざしながら、Ｈさんに、 「こんな大きな物もらいをこしらえて、あんたは欲ばりですよ。なにが欲しいのですか」と笑って言った。大きな笑い声であった。 面白い先生だと思い、Ｈさんは、気がらくになった。 それから、先生は、Ｈさんの首のつけ根を押さえてみて、 「あんたは、大分我が強いね」と言うのであった。 Ｈさんは、どきりとした。 というのは、Ｈさんは、小さい時から強情な子で、兄や姉から「針金」という綽名をつけられたほどであった。自分の我の強いことは、よく知っている。しかし、こんなところで、初対面の先生から、こうもずばりと、それを指摘されようとは思わなかった。 さっきは、面白そうな先生だと思ったが、こんどは、すこし恐くなった。魂の奥底まで見抜かれているような気がした。 「どうして、それがわかりますか」と小さくなって訊いてみた。 「どうだ、当ったろう。あはははは」 先生は、いかにも愉快そうに、高らかに笑った。 十九 Ｈさんの目は、すっかり治った。 「全くふしぎでたまりません」と言ったら、 「この浄化療法は、誰でもできる。馬鹿でも、チョンでも、できる」と先生は笑っていた。 「どうしてでしょうか」と理由をきいても、 「あとになれば、わかる」とだけしか答えなかった。 「あとのなれば……」 それは、どういうことだろうか。Ｈさんは、先生が自分を専門の治療師に仕立てようと考えているな、ということを、その場の雰囲気で感じた。 と同時に、 （これは用心しなければならない） そういう気持ちも湧いた。 Ｈさんは、その浄化療法というもので、一人でも病人が助けられるものなら、そのやり方を習得して、人助けをしたいと考える。しかし、これを専門にする人になるのは、厭であった。 だから、それからも幾度か先生に会っているが、うやむやな態度でいた。 ある日、先生は、 「あんたは、英語の女教師だが、英語なんかは誰にだって教えられるよ。英語を教えていたって、人類は救えない。イギリスへ行けば、ロンドンの橋の下の乞食だって、英語をしゃべってるよ」と言った。 Ｈさんは、心の中で反発するものを感じながら、口には出ない言葉を投げつけていた。 （それはロンドンの橋の下の乞食だって、英語をしゃべる。しかし、そういう人たちにシェイクスピアは読めやしない。それなのに、先生は、あんなことをぬけぬけと言う） Ｈさんは、英語の教授法には、特別の工夫をこらし、一っぱしの自信をもっていた。それだけに、「英語なんかは誰にだって教えられる」という言葉には、すくなからず自尊心を傷つけられた。しかし、そのものずばりで言ってのける調子に、なんとなく魅力があった。だから、反発するものを感じながらも、腹は立たなかった。 いや、英語そのものを教えることよりも、その教育を通して人の心の改造をするということを考えていたＨさんは、何年かの教師生活ののち、今ようやくその無力さを感じはじめて来ていた。それだけに、先生の言葉は、たしかに痛かった。自信が、足もとから崩れるような不安を感じた。 二十 昭和十九年の夏、日本の戦勢は急速に衰えて行った。 心ある人々は、無気味な空襲の下で、祖国の命運も既に時間の問題となっていることを感じていた。 この年の七月末、先生一家は、熱海市伊豆山西足川に家を見つけて、そこへ疎開した。 五月に箱根の強羅に移られた大先生も、ついで九月、熱海東山へ移転された。 しかし、先生が熱海へ疎開したといっても、家の中に落ちついていることなど到底許されなかった。妻子を一応安全地帯へ移したというだけで、先生は東奔西走、自分の家を顧みるゆとりもなかった。 東北地方から帰って来ても、熱海の家へは寄らないで、そのまま関西地方へ――というようなことも珍らしくなかった。 そして、その関西地方からの帰りも、やはり家へは寄らずに、そのまま東京へ。こういう目まぐるしい生活であった。 こんなこともあった。何処かの旅からの帰り、先生は、東山荘の大先生を訪ねると、大先生はにこにこして、 「おまえの子供が生れたよ」と言う。 そこで先生は、初めて赤児が生まれたということを知った。しかも、その時は、ひどい難産であった。 まだ家へも寄っていない先生は、ちょっとテレたような表情をして、 「なにしろ、長い旅だったものですから」と言った。 この家は、今はある会社の寮になっているが、先生が借りた時は、小さな家だった。 先生は、八畳と六畳の事務所を建て増しした。それから更に、二階家を建てた。これを神光閣と名づけた。 これは、戦争も終ってからのことであるが、その神光閣の一室――二十畳の部屋には絨壇〔緞〕（じゅうたん）が敷いてある。それを目の不自由な助手の一人が、毎朝掃除をすることになっていたが、小さいゴミなどは見えない。 だから、他の人々も、同情して手伝ってくれる。同情してくれるのは嬉しいが、やっぱりその助手にとっては、つらい。 先生は、そういう場面を見て、 「もういいよ。もうおやめ」と助手に言う。 そして、その助手に、あとでこう言った。 「おまえが第一動作をやるから、みんながやり初めるんだよ。何事も、第一動作をやることが尊い」 先生の声はやさしかった。 助手の不自由な目に、キラリと光るものがあった。 二十一 十九年の秋であった。先生は東北地方へ出かけた。国民服に、ゲートルを巻いて……。 空襲の警報で、列車は幾度か停まり、乗客は鎧戸を下した窓の下で、生きた心地もしない時間を過すのであった。 しかし、先生は、心配しなかった。 （おれは、神様の兵隊をこしらえているのだから、大丈夫、ご守護はある） 教習中、何度も防空壕へ飛び込まなければならないこともあった。 そういう時、ある人が、 「ご守護があるのだから、防空壕へ入らなくてもいいでしょう」と言った。 先生は、怒った。 「ご守護の上に、あぐらをかいていてはいけないのだ。人事を尽くして天命を待ってばかりいるのは間違っている。我を出して、人力だけで押し切ろうとするのもいけないが、何もしないで、ただ貰い物を待っているのはいけない」 二十二 昭和二十年の三月、空襲はいよいよ激しくなってきた。毎晩、広大な地域が焼け失せた。 女子大学の講師から教授に推選するという先輩のすすめを辞退して、Ｈさんは、熱海の天国会本部の奉仕生活に入った。 それより二ヵ月程前に、Ｈさんは、その決心を先生に披瀝した。ところが、先生は、「よく決心がついたね。それでよろしい」とは言わなかった。 さぞ賞めてくれるだろうと思い、先生の悦ぶ顔を想像して訪ねて行ったのであったが、案に相違して、先生は冷淡であった。 （あれほど私に勧めた先生が、これはどうしたということか） Ｈさんは、黙ってこっちの顔を見つめている先生の顔を、戸惑いした気持で見つめていた。 しばらくして、先生は言った。 「無理をして助手にならなくてもいいのですよ。あんたの心の奥に、大学教授という肩書に対する執着が少しでもあったら、今のうちにその方へ行きなさい。なにも私に義理立てをして、無理をする必要はない」 突っ放されたような気がして、張りつめていた心も急にゆるんでしまった。 しかし、がっかりしながらも、先生の本当の心持を読み取ろうと、胸の騒ぎを出来るだけ落ちつかせて、次の言葉を待った。 先生は、そのＨさんを憐れむように見つめて、 「神様はね、どうしてもと縋って来る者には、許しを与えて、お使いになる。恩に着せて、してあげますという人には用はないのだよ。もう一度、よく考え直すことだね」と言うのであった。 泣き出したい気持で、下をうつむいていると、先生は、最後のとどめをさすように、 「やめるなら、今のうちだよ」と言った。 Ｈさんは、家へ帰って、じっくりと考えてみた。 （私の心の隅には、まだ多分に虚栄心が残っている。名誉ある地位を捨てて、人類救済のために自分を犠牲にするのだというような昂ぶった心が残っている。なんという勿体ぶった、いやらしい心であろう。そうした自分を、立派だと思い込んで眺めている第二の自分があるのだ。なんという自己満足、なんというセンチメンタリズム！） その翌日、Ｈさんは、また熱海へ行った。 そして、頭を下げて、ただこれだけを言った。 「どうかこの私に、ご用をお許し下さい。お願いします」 その顔には、ひたむきな、この道一すじの希魄と、昨日までのくだらない執着を恥じる純情さが現われていた。 こうして、肉親の反対を越えて、Ｈさんは先生の助手となった。 先生という人は、助手一人を選ぶにも、このくらい用意周到であった。 二十三 Ｈさんは、先生の助手になった。 ある朝、先生は、正面の床の前に坐り、下手の方に、Ｈさんが坐っていた。 治療を受ける人は、まだ一人も来ていなかった。 女中が、三種類の新聞を持って来て、座敷の入り口のところに置いて行った。 「その新聞、どれでもいいから、一つ持って来なさい」と先生が言った。 一つと言うが、どの新聞が一番読みたいのかわからなかったので、Ｈさんは、三種類の新聞を全部持って行って、先生の前に置いた。そして、気をきかせたつもりで、引き下がって来た。 二三分黙っていた先生は、 「あんたは、素直ということを知っているかね」と改まった口調で言う。 どう答えていいかわからず、Ｈさんは先生の顔を見つめた。 すると、先生は、 「私は今、なんと言ったか覚えているかね。新聞を一つと言ったでしょう。あんたは気をきかせたつもりで、三つ全部持って来たが、それはあんたが素直でない証拠ですよ。本当の素直というのは、何もむずかしいことではない。それは、言われた通りにするということなんだよ。私は、あんたより深く物事を考えている。その私が一つと言ったのは、もうすぐ治療を受ける人達がここへ入って来るが、その人たちも待っている間は新聞を読みたいだろう。そう考えたから、一つと言ったのだ。その人達のために、二部は残して置こうと思うからなんですよ。わかったかね」 Ｈさんは、びっくりした。 自分は学校教育に十九年も携わって来た。そのあいだに偉い精神的指導者を求めて、いろいろな有名人にも会いに行った。しかし、こんな教育をする人には、これまで会ったことがない。Ｈさんは、思わず頭を下げた。 やはり、その頃のことであった。 玄関に、来訪を告げる声がしたので、Ｈさんは、階下に降りて行った。 来意を聞くと、用事で先生にお目にかかりたい、と言う。 Ｈさんが、それを先生に伝えると、先生は立って玄関に出て行った。 しばらくして、二階に上って来た先生は、 「あんたは、さっき下に降りた時、玄関の靴や下駄がどんなふうになっていたか、それに気がついたかね」とＨさんに言った。 Ｈさんは、取次ぎのことだけ考えていて、それには気がつかなかったので、黙っていた。 すると、先生は、こう言った。 「履物が一杯で、しかも乱雑になっていたから、今の客は立つところもないくらいだった。あんたは、偉い理想や、高遠な思想の話はするけれど、こういう小さい誠の実践になると、まるでゼロだね。人間は、心くばり、気くばりのできる人にならなければだめだ。そうでなければ、昼の世界の建設には役に立たないよ」 Ｈさんは、穴に入りたいような恥しさで、赤い顔をしていた。 二十四 先生は、半分冗談に、婦人に言う。 「おれは、毎日病人ばかりを相手にしている。せめてうまいものぐらい食べる楽しみがなくてはな」 事実、先生は、よく食べた。 昭和十六年の春、先生は弟子達を集めて、「天狗会」というのをつくった。 「天狗会」の会費は、毎月五円で、それを積み立てておいては、みんなでうまいものを食べる。そういう時の先生は、いかにも嬉しそうであった。 しかし、その年の十二月八日には、太平洋戦争がはじまり、食糧もだんだん乏しくなって行った。 それでも、先生は、あきらめなかった。 家の子郎党を引き連れて、あっちこっちと、うまいもの屋を探しては、食べに出かけた。 特に、ソバが好きで、モリを五つぐらい食べる事は平気だった。東北へ行った時、椀子ソバというのを、五十杯も食べた。いくら一口で食べられるソバでも、五十杯は驚いたねと、その席にいた弟子たちは、目を見張った。 けれども、先生は、他の者がどうであろうと、自分だけうまいものを食べるという人ではなかった。性格的にそういうことの出来る人ではなかった。 食糧難の時代、先生は旅先で、当時ではもうめったに口に入れられないご馳走を出された。一緒に行った弟子は、咽喉を鳴らして、遠慮なくそれを食べてしまった。 あとで、先生は、その男をたしなめた。 「あの家の人のことを考えなさい。いい気になって、みんな食べてしまうやつがあるものか。家の人のために、残しておいてやるものだ」 そういう優しいところのある人であった。 やはり、その頃、浄霊のお礼に信者から白米を一升五合貰ったことがあった。 先生は、それを見て、 「この白い米は、春代にやってくれよ」と夫人に言った。 先生は、目の中へ入れても痛くないというように春代ちゃんを可愛がっていた。上の三六ちゃんと、下の博子ちゃんが亡くなったため、春代ちゃんが一人ポツンと小さく、あどけない存在であったからである。 このことがあってから、兄や姉から、「白米の春代ちゃん」とからかわれた。先生が幼い妹を可愛がるのが、やはり嫉ましかったのであろう。 食べることが大好きな先生ではあったが、家の台所は、決して贅沢ではなかった。 昭和十八年頃、ある弟子の一人は、ときどき台所の戸棚を覗いてみるが、なんにも、はいっていないことが多かったと言っている。 終戦の前年あたりは、いよいよひどかった。 雑炊は、水分が九十パーセントで、しかも大根、人参などが殆どといってよいくらいで、肝腎の米は、ホンの一握りという食事であった。それが、毎日だった。 しかし、先生は、それで満足していた。 先生は、ある時、弟子たちに言った。 「私は、食事はどんなものでも頂ける。決して、とやかく不満を感ずることはない。ただ、同じ材料を使うならば、うまく食べられるように、料理の仕方について注意することはある。 二十五 先生は、どういうものか、軍人には特に峻烈であった。 終戦の直後、だからもう日本の軍人はなくなっていたのであるが、ある日、元海軍のＫさんが、先生を訪ねて行った。 Ｋさんは、潜水艦に乗っていたが、胸を悪くして、熱海の旅館（まだ海軍関係の病棟になっていた）で療養していた。 たまたま、旅館の近くの豆腐屋で、先生のことを聞き、会ってみたいと思った。 そこで電話すると、 電話口に出た人は、大きな声で、 「軍人か。軍人なら、度性骨がなくちゃならんぞ」と言った。 Ｋさんは、びっくりした。 訪ねて行くと、先生が出てきた。 浴衣がけで、兵士帯をグルグル巻きにして、目をむいて立っている。 そして、Ｋさんが、来意を告げると、たった一言、 「あんたかい、軍人というのは」 やはりその頃、復員した元軍人のＹさんが、リュックをかついで、先生の玄関に立った。教えを乞おうというのである。 出て来た先生は、つっけんどんに、 「君は誰だ」と怒ったように言った。 夫人がそばから、 「Ｙさんですよ。このあいだもいらしたじゃありませんか」と取りなすように言った。 すると、先生は、ニベもなく、吐き捨てるように言った。 「おれは知らん」 戦場で目をやられて、全く視力が効かなくなったＳさんは、叔母に手を引かれて、先生の家にやって来た。元陸軍の大尉である。 「どうしたのだ」 「砲弾の破片でやられました」 「見えないのか」 「全然見えません」 「しかし、君は、履物の脱ぎ方が悪い。目が見えないからといって、自分の履物ぐらい、もうすこしきちんと揃えて脱げるはずだ」 これは戦時中であるが、在郷軍人会の分会長をしている人が、先生を訪ねた。 先生は、 「君の目はきつ過ぎる。もっと目をやわらかくしなさい」と言った。 いつも先生は、軍人の目には角があると言っていた。軍人だったものは、匂いを嗅いだだけでわかるらしかった。 学校の教師にも手きびしかった。 ある時、小学校の校長だったが、今は退職しているＮさんが、先生を訪ねた。 「あんたは、教員を何年ぐらいやっていたかね」と先生が訊く。 「はい、二十五年やりました」とＮさんは答えた。 すると、先生は、目玉をむいて、 「その罪は、戦犯以上だぞ」と言った。 二十六 先生は、「言いわけ」を嫌った。 その女性は、末っ子だったので、特別に可愛がられて育った。いくらでも甘えることが出来たし、大抵のわがままが通った。賞められても叱られた記憶がないので、知らぬ間に、自分はいい子だと思い込む癖がついてしまった。 従って、おとなになってからも、人から注意されたり、批評されたりすることは、我慢のならないことであった。 本部に奉仕に上ってからも、へまをして、先生から注意を受けると、そのたびに必ず言いわけが出る。 「あんたは、すべきことをしなかったのだよ」と言われると、 「ああ、それは今しようと思っていたのです」と言いわけが口を出てしまう。 「実は、それをしようとおもってはいたのですが、これこれの理由で出来なかったのです」という言いわけも出て来る。 そういう時、先生は、いつも強く言った。 「思うだけでは、何もならない。やらなければ、思わないのも同じだ。何故、黙って、済みませんと言えないのだ。ただ済みませんでしたではすまされないのか」 この女性が、ある人から先生に告げ口されたことがあった。そんなことはしなかったのであるが、したように告げ口されて、そのことで先生から注意を受けた。 彼女はむきになって、言いわけした。 「それは、そうではありません」とも言い、 「私は、そんなことをした覚えはありません」とも言った。 すると、先生は、静かな声で、 「あんた、神様を信じるかね」と訊いた。 「はい、信じます」 「本当に信じているのなら、たとえ告げ口されたことが本当でなくても、言いわけをしないでいられるはずではないかね。神様が、ご存知なのだからいいではないか。言いわけをしないで、黙って時を待つことの出来る人間になれてこそ、本当に神様がわかっている人と言えるんだよ」 二十七 戦時中のことである。 税務署から、先生へ、二百万円の課税をするという通知が来た。 さすがに、先生はあわてた。 先生は、金が入れば使ってしまうから、手持ちの金と言ってもたいしたことはない。払えと言ったって、到底払えるものではない。 「ない袖は振れやしないよ」 先生は、ほとほと困った。 しかし、抗議しようにも、肝腎の帳簿がない。もともと、そんなものは用意してなかったのである。 税務署から査察に来た。 先生は慄え上っってしまった。 （どうしたものかな） 先生は、算盤が苦が手である。その頭もない。 そこで、弟子たちが手分けして、いそいで帳簿をつくろうということになった。 と言っても、弟子たちに、その知識はない。税に明るい人を呼んで来て、徹夜でやってしまおうということに、衆議一決した。 その時、Ａさんという弟子のうちでも目をかけられている人が、 「こうなったら、先生に奉仕しよう」とみんなに言った。 「よし。裸になろう。着るものは全部出してしまおう」と誰かが賛成する。 「しかし、いくら裸一貫といっても、冬だけは何か着なくてはいられないから、冬服一着だけは残すことにしよう。あとは全部差し出すのだ」とＡさんが言う。 「そうしよう」 「そうしよう」 あとで、先生は、この話を聞いて、感激した。涙ぐんで、 「その気持ちが尊いのだよ」と言った。 こう言うと、先生はいかにも、入った金は右から左へ見境いなく使ってしまう人のようであるが、、俗にいう「公私の別」は、実に厳格に守った人であった。 台所にある味噌、醤油の類まで、心ない使い方はさせなかった。 いろいろの人から来た手紙――その便箋を綴じておいて、メモに使った。夜、寝る時も、それを枕もとにおいといて、思いついたこと、あるいは書こうと思う手紙の返事の要領などを、その裏に書きつけておくのであった。時には、原稿も便箋の裏に書いた。 ある年の元日、参拝のあとで、一人の弟子が新調して貰った和服を着換えずに、そのままの姿で、部屋の掃除をしていた。 そこへ、先生が通りかかった。 そして、それを見て、きつく弟子をたしなめた。 「掃除をする時には、ちゃんとそのような着物に着替えてしなさい。物を大事にしないと、神様からもう何も与えられなくなる。物を大事にしなさい。その感謝を忘れないでいなさい」 幹部のある人が、二等車、今の一等車に乗って、先生から怒られた。 「大先生でも三等だ。君は、四等か五等の車に乗りたまえ」 しかし、使わなければならない時は、先生は惜し気なく金を使う。なければ祈ってつくる。 ある時はあるが、ない時はない。 ふところ手をして歩いていても、先生の財布に金はない。あっても、金銭の出し入れは面倒臭い。 だから、何処へ行っても、支払いはみな夫人がする。本人は、大名気分であった。 大名気分ではあったが、勘どころは、ちゃんと見ていた。 ある時、助手の一人が、新しい紙に、事務上の報告を書いて、先生に差し出した。 先生は、それを見て言った。 「私のところへ持ってくるメモのようなものは、使いふるしの紙でよろしい。物というものは、すべて神様から頂いたものである。一枚の紙といえども、大切に使わなければならない。物に対する感謝の心がなければ、必ず不自由をして困るようになる」 二十八 何事でも、先生は、想念ということに重点を置いて、その事を見た。 昭和二十年の春頃であった。 Ｋ子さんは、熱海に奉仕に上っていたが、先生の許しを得て、東京の姉の家へ一晩泊りで帰らせてもらうことになった。 午前中、東山の出張所の用事をして、そこからすぐ駅へ行けば、正午頃の列車に間に合うという見積りを立てて、その朝、先生の家を出た。 そして、出張所のこまごまとした用事を片づけていた。 浄霊の手伝いをしている最中に、Ｋ子さんは、忘れ物をしてきた事に気がついた。 と言って、もう取りに帰る暇はない。 いつも、忘れ物はないかよく注意しなさいと先生から言われているＫ子さんは先生に知られてはまずいと思って、何気ないふりをして階下に降りて行った。 そして、こっそり先生の家へ電話して、奉仕の人に出張所まで持って来て貰うように頼んだ。 その時、相手の人は、 「ちょうど使いに出るついでがあるから、持って行って上げるよ。なに、ちょっと寄り道すればいいのだから」と言ってくれた。 Ｋ子さんは，ほっとした。これでいいと思った。 それからまた、そっと屋敷へ戻って、何食わぬ顔をしていた。 しばらくして、玄関のあく音がした。 Ｋ子さんは、また素知らぬ顔で降りて行って、忘れた品物を受取り、黙って二階へ上がって行った。 そのＫ子さんを見ていて、臭いと睨んだのか、 「今、誰が来たのか、何しに来たのか」と先生は訊問するように言った。 誤魔化してもだめだと思って、Ｋ子さんは、、事の顛末を話した。 そして、弁解するような気持ちで、 「電話をかけましたら、ちょうどお使いに出るついでがあるＢさんが電話口に出ましたので、Ｂさんに持って来て貰いました」と、ちょうど使いに出るついでというところに力を入れて言った。 一二分黙っていた先生は、 「忘れものをするのは、仕方がない。持って来て貰うのもいい。だが、なぜ、使いに出るついでがあったからをつけ加えなければならなかったか、それが、あんたにわかっているかね」と言う。 なるほど、寄り道と言えば簡単に思われるが、先生の家から出張所までは、本通りから大分入り込んでいる上に、坂道を上がらなければならず、本当は、ちょっと面倒なことであった。 （それを、ついでと言ったのがいけなかったのだな） そう思って、Ｋ子さんは、小さくなっていた。 先生は重ねて言う。 「そういうことは、本当に済まなかったという謙虚な心でなしに、少しでも自分をよく思われようとする想念から出る。それをつけ加えなかったら、ずっと謙虚で美しい。事は小さいようだが、あんたのその想念は、感心出来ない。自己を価値づけようとする想念、そのいやな想念を、私はあんたから徹底的に取り除いて上げたいのだ。わかったかね」 「はい。よくわかりました。私はまだまだだめでした」とＫ子さんは、頭を下げた。 そのＫ子さんに、先生は、やさしい声になって言った。 「水晶の身魂になるまで、磨き磨きして、そうして浄まって行くのだよ。絶えず磨かなければね」 二十九 「人は信じられない」 先生が信頼する弟子の一人に、こう言ったことがある。 弟子は意外だという表情をした。 それを見て、先生は言った。 「驚くことはない。一年ぐらいつきあってもだめだ。三年ぐらいつきあわなければわからない。それも、つきあった範囲においてだけだ」 「つきあった範囲においてだけとは、どういうことですか」 「例えば、女房だ。ある男が、女房と二十年暮らして来たとする。その男が女房を理解する限度は、その二十年の女房としての人物だけだ。それ以外はわからない」 事実、先生は、たやすくは人を信じなかった。 ある時、ある分会長が、平素よく働く助手を連れて、先生のところへ行った。 「あれは、実によく働きます。物になると考えています」と、その分会長は、助手が引き下がったあとで、先生に言った。 すると、先生は、きっぱりと、 「あれは、だめだ」と言った。 分会長は、そんなはずはないと思って、先生の言葉を信用する気になれなかった。 ところが、それからしばらくして、その助手は信仰を捨ててしまった。 「全く、先生の目の鋭いのには驚いた」と分会長は、述懐している。 先生は、人を見抜く時間は早かった。それが、「三年ぐらいはつきあわなければ……」と言うのである。慎重な先生であった。 この慎重さがわからないで、「なんでも人の言うことはすぐきいてしまう」という批評をする人もあった。 「たしかに、すぐ人を信じてしまうというところはあった。しかし、何しろあの大きな目だ。あの目で一睨みすれば、大抵の人の腹の中は見えてしまうだろう。だから、信じ易いというよりも、早く十分に見て、そして早く十分に信じたと言い直した方がいい」 三十 戦後二十一年から二十二年にかけて、教勢は一度に伸びて行った。天国会だけでも、毎月千人から二千人の入信者があった。入信競争時代と言っていいだろう。 地方分会は、あちらにみ、こちらにも、続いて出来た。先生ひとりではどうにもならないので、幹部が代理教修に飛びまわった。 分会の信者も、どんどんふえて、分会長が新しい信者をつれて本部へ来ることも多くなる。 分会長からその信者を紹介されると、先生は、分会長のいない時に、そっと信者に、 「あんたの先生を立てて下さいね。頼みますよ」と言うのであった。 布教上の失策で、ある分会長は、先生のところへ謝罪に行った。 その失策は、その人の責任ではなかったが、しかし、失策は失策である。 その分会長は、腹を切る覚悟をしていた。 その詳しい報告を聞くと、先生は、 「ウーン」と唸った。 五分ぐらい、物も言わなかった。 分会長は、どういうことになるのだろうと、亀の子のように首を縮めて、裁断を待っていた。 先生は、やがて静かに、 「よし。その罪は、おまえの罪じゃない」 大先生の面会の日には、分会長たちが集って、いろいろと信仰上の質問をする。 だから、その前日には、分会長たちはみんなそれぞれの質問事項をもって、互いに相談する。そして、その結果を、先生に報告する。 そういう時、先生はいつも、分会長たちの質問事項の中に、必ず一つか二つ、自分の質問を加えておくのであった。 それは、先生自身では十分知っている事柄であるが、それを大先生の口から分会長たちに説き聞かせてもらうことによって、一層強く確かに彼らを教育することが出来るという考えからであった。 先生は、なくなる八カ月前に、分会長たちを戒めて言った。 「私どもは、二十年に近い歴史をもっているとしても、弾圧のために、治療面に重点をおいて来たため、宗教家的な活動を始めてから、まだ満二年に達しない。従って、宗教家としては、赤ん坊同様のものだ。けれども、観音力をお取次ぎすることによって、この素晴らしい発展を来たした。私どもは、沢山の信者から尊敬されている。しかし、それを自分の力だと思ったら大変なことだ。ただ、一般信者の人々より一足先きに、この道に入り、それだけ道順をくわしく知っているというだけに過ぎない。言わば、案内人なのだ。ただ道順を知っているというだけでは、別に偉くはない。目下修行中の身だということを決して忘れてはいけない」 三十一 ケチケチ、パッパの経済学―― 先生は、よくこう言った。 神様のためには、パッパと使え。 そのかわり、自分のためにはケチになれ。 先生は、この中島経済学を、生涯守った。 信者からの献金は、すべてみな神様のものだ。だから、神様の仕事のためにだけ使わなくてはならない。 こういう信念から、先生は、いつも、 「私事のために、いたずらに使ってはいけない。親が呉れと言っても、そういう金はやる必要はない」と言っていた。 いばるな。 おこるな。 はやまるな―― 先生は、又、よくこう言った。 「いばってはいけない。いばればいばるほど、人は逃げて行ってしまう。おこればおこるほど、神は離れ去ってしまう。そして、はやまればはやまるほど、自分の中の自分がわからなくなってしまう」 弟子たちは、これを、先生の「るな三訓」と言っていた。 神様に休みはない―― 先生は、又、よくこう言った。 先生があまりつめて仕事をするので、弟子の一人が、 「すこしお休みになったらどうですか」と言った。 すると、先生は、 「神様に休みというものはない」と答えて、又仕事を続けた。 人間は死ぬまで修業―― 先生は、又、よくこう言った。 「人間というものは、生き変り、死に変り、永遠の生命をもっているものだと、私は大先生から教えられた。このことが本当にわかったら、大変なことだ。今日修業したことが、皆身について、霊界に行けばそれだけ自分が伸びている。更に、次の世界までその徳を持って行って、その上に修業をつむ。そうして更に次の世界に行けば、いよいよ自分というものは伸びている。私はね、ときどき、一万年後の自分を考えてみることがあるのだが、楽しみなものだよ」 おれに生命を呉れるか―― 先生は、入信したいという相手に、よくこう言った。 命を惜しむ者を、先生は、自分の弟子にしようとはしなかった。神よりもおのれを愛するような者に、どうして人間の救済が出来ようか。 「霊か肉か」――先生は、それを相手にも厳しく追求させた。そして、肉と答えるような者を信者にしようとはしなかった。 「おまえの五六十年の命をよこせ。そうすれば、私はおまえに永遠の生命をやる」と先生は言っていた。 「誰の紙幣だ。神様のだ。きちんと耳を揃えておけ」――先生は、そう言う。 後年、先生の家の台所をまかせられていたある娘が、どうしても五十銭の収支が合わないので、自分の財布から五十銭銅貨を出して穴埋めしておいたことがあった。 あとで、このことがわかって、 「私が立て替えて置きました」と娘が言うと、先生は怒った。 「きみは、自分の金、自分の金というが、自分の金だって神様のものだ。不注意で収支計算が合わず、金が足りなくなったからといって、自分の財布から出して置けば同じだという心がよくない。収支を合わせれば、それで事が済むと考えている。その心がいけないのだ」 たしかに、先生は几帳面だった。 しかし、金の勘定は、決して上手ではなかった。いや、むしろ下手だったと言ったほうがいい。自分は下手だったけれど、だからと言って、相手のルーズさを容赦するような人ではなかった。 だから、このあと、やはり先生の台所で働いていた別の娘が、あてがわれる金だけでは賄い切れなくて、どうにも泣きたいようなことが幾度かあったが、彼女はその時のことをこう述懐している。 「足りないからといって、自分の財布からは出せず、といって足りませんなどと先生に言えば、神様の金をなんと思って使っているのかと叱られるし、いっそ古新聞紙で袋貼りでもして、幾らかでも貯金しておこうかと、真面目に考えたこともありました」 ルーズは絶対に許さない。 ちゃんときまりをつけなければならない。 これが先生の金に対する態度であった。 だから、自分は衣食のことには無頓着で、いくら金が入ったのか出たのか知ろうともしないくせに、相手が金について無神経なのは見ていられなかった。 殊に、宗教家となってからは、金は神様のものという考えから、一銭でもおろそかに扱わせなかった。 先生は、ある時の幹部会で言った。 「教えを説く者は、常に心が清浄でなければならない。ところが、金銭の収支や日常のやりくりに頭を使っていると、いつのまにか心が濁ってくる。かと言って、そういうことも疎かにはできないから、私は信頼できる家内と、誠実で有能な会計事務奉仕者を育てて、一切をまかせきっている」 先生は、この信念をもって終始した。 ――炭のつぎ方一つにも。 総ての物は、神から賜ったものである。それを、自分のもの、自分の力で得たものと思うところに、間違いがある。物の本当の値打ちを知り、むだ使いをしないこと。寒い日も、暖かい日も、同じように炭をつぐのは愚である。 こういう小さなことにも、十分に気を配ること。それができれば、本当の信仰心ができたと言える。 ――順序ということについて。 ある時、先生は、弟子たちに厳しく言った。 「夜寝る時に、着ていたものを枕もとにおく人があるが、ズボンとか靴下は、下に着けるものだ。それを枕もとにおくような者は、立派な人間になれない」 又、ある時、旅行先で、先生が顔を洗おうと思ったら、洗面器が便所の手洗い（と言っても、洋式になっているから実に清潔なのであるが）の側においてある。 先生は、わざわざ奉仕者を呼んで、大層きびしく注意した。 「一体、私を誰だと思っているのか。信仰に入ってから数十年というもの、魂のくもりを少しでもすくなくしようと、努力に努力を重ねて来ている。その私に、この洗面器で顔を洗えというのか。魂が曇るから、すぐ取り換えなさい」 三十二 まだ宗教になっていなかった頃であったが、先生は、善言讃詞を印刷して、弟子たちに一枚ずつ与えて置いた。 戦争が終って、まだ幾年もたっていない。人々の胸には、大きな不安があった。絶望の哲学が、わがもの顔に、人々の心に食い入って来た。死を求める人人がふえた。 景勝地熱海の錦ガ浦は、いつのまにか自殺の名所と呼ばれるようになっていた。多くの若者、壮年、いや老人までが、毎日のように断崖から身を躍らせて、死の国へと旅立って行った。男も死に、女も死んだ。 先生は、このことをどんなに嘆いたか知れない。新聞の下の段の方に、「錦ガ浦で投身自殺」と小さく出ている記事を読んで、じっと考え込んでしまう時もあった。涙ぐんでいる時もあった。 もともと先生は涙もろい人であった。映画を見て涙をにじませるなどということは、毎度のことであった。その先生にとって、人間が自分で自分の命を断つということ、断たなければならなかったということは、とてもたまらないことであった。 しかも、それらの人間の霊が、行き着くところまで行けずに、あの世とこの世との境をさまよっている。そして、先生の住む伊豆山西足川から錦ガ浦は、指呼の間にある。その暗い水の上を、死者の霊が、啜り泣いている。 先生は、どうしても自分の手で供養してやらなければならないと考えた。 ある日、先生は、数人の弟子を連れ、一隻の小船に乗り込んだ。その断崖の下では、白い波が岩を噛んでいるような時でも、沖へ出ると、熱海の海は静かである。初島が、その静かな海の上に、眠ったように浮んでいる。 先生と弟子たちとの供養が始り、善言讃詞を奉唱することになった。 合掌して、先生は、朗々と唱え始める。 しかし、弟子は、ただ口をもぐもぐさせるばかりである。その弟子たちのうち、一人だけは暗誦していたが、他の者は、まだ善言讃詞を覚えていないのであった。仕方なく、口をぱくぱくさせていた。 あとで、先生は大喝一声、弟子たちを叱りつけた。 「おれは、伊達や酔狂で、おまえたちに善言讃詞を渡してあるのじゃないぞ。おれが、せっかく印刷して渡してやったのに、おまえたちは、それを覚えて来ない。一体、善言讃詞をどう思っているのだ」 弟子たちは、一度に頭を下げて、舟底に平つくばってしまった。 亡くなる二十日程前に、先生に会いにいったある信者が、こう言っている。 「お訪ねすると、二階から下りて来られた先生は、玄関に立って、こう言われました。君は、私が本当に叱るところまで行かんなあ。そこで私が、どうしてですかと訊くと、先生は、にこりともしないで、言われました。君は、叱られると逃げてしまうからなあ。私が入信して四年目のことでした」 「叱りは、光なりだ」 先生は、よくこれを言った。 役に立つと思うから叱るのだ。叱ってもだめだと思えば叱りはしない。 これが、先生の本心であった。 実に多くの弟子、信者が、先生に叱られている。叱り飛ばされて、頭の上に雷が落ちたように慄え上がった者もいる。やんわりと柔らかく叱られて、却って恐くなった者もいる。 しかし、叱られた人は、あとで、こう言っている。 「やっぱり違っていた。叱り方に重味があった」 ある人が、失敗をした。 先生は、非常に怒って、 「そんなことで、教師（宗教上の）がつとまるか。資格を返せ」と言った。 しかし、すぐそのあと、笑って、 「まあ、一回だけはこらえる」と言った。 叱られる。 言いわけをする。 また、叱られる。 また、言いわけをする。 またまた、叱られる。 そこで、黙ってしまう。 すると、先生は、静かに言う。 「わかったかね」 教師になったばかりの青年があった。 布教に歩いて、成果の挙がらなかった時などは、先生から叱られると思ってびくびくしていた。先輩たちが、その誠意と努力の足りないことを指摘されているのを見て、自分もきっと叱られるにちがいないと、小さくなっていた。 ところが、先生は、その青年を叱らなかった。 （おまえは、教師になりたてのほやほやだからな） そう考えているにちがいない先生の腹の中が、その青年にもわかった。 青年は、却って恥かしくなった。 「自分も先生から、一対一で叱られるような人間に早くなりたいと思いました」とあとで述懐している。 先生は、叱る値打ちのある人間でなければ、叱りはしなかった。 「蹴飛ばされても、小便をひっかけられても逃げ出さないような人間」――先生は、ふだん、よくこれを言っていたが、そういう人間でなければ叱りはしなかった。言葉を換えて言えば、信用できる人間だと思っているから叱るのであった。 「他人が叱られているのだからと思って、よそごとのような顔をしていると、それはおまえのことだぞと、よく叱られたものです」とある弟子は言った。 叱られたあと、なんだか誇りにも似たものを感じたと言う弟子もある。 「先生に叱られたあと、そのことを同僚に話すと、同僚はみんな明るい雰囲気でそれを聞いている。叱られたことは叱られたことなのだが、おれは先生に叱られたんだぞ、先生は叱り甲斐のない者は叱りはしないんだぞ――こういう誇りに似たものが、私の胸の中にあるので、話がすこしも湿っぽくならないのだ。とにかく、先生は、全くふしぎな人だった」とその人は言っている。 三十三 初めて奉仕に上がった娘が、すぐにも浄霊の手伝いをさせて貰えると思っていたのに、案に相違して、薄暗い台所に連れて行かれ、「あんたの修業場所はここだよ」と言われた。 娘は、先生のぎょろりとした目にすくんでしまった。そして思わずつぶやいた。 （ああ、ここで修業するのかなあ） しかし、三カ月たって、 「あんたも、大分慣れたね」と優しく言われた時、その娘は、嬉しいというよりも、先生の大きな目がうるんでいるのを見てびっくりした。 台所の薄暗さも、薄暗いとは感じなかった。 この娘ばかりではない。自分のふところに飛び込んで来たすべての奉仕者に対して、徹底的に下座の業をさせた。 掃除、洗濯、使い走り…… 慣れない仕事をさせられて、へまばかりやり、娘たちは毎日のように注意された。 「嬢や坊やでは、神様のご用は出来んよ」と、大本教のお筆先にある言葉を、よく引用して訓した。 しつけは厳格であった。容赦はなかった。 しかし、何カ月かやらせて、これでまずまずよしというところまで来ると、先生は常にやさしくねぎらった。 「あんたも、よく辛抱したね。どこまで続くかしらと思ったよ。人間は、どんな運命に逢うかわからないから、どういう事態になっても、何でもやれる人間になっておかなければいけないのだよ。あんたも可哀そうだと思ったけれど、今まで下のご用をさせておいた。下のご用をやっておけば、自分が人を使うようになった時、その人の苦労が察せられるからね。やれば自分でもやれるが、やる必要のない身分になって、人のして呉れるのを有難く受けとるのと、その反対に、やろうとして出来ないから、人にやらせるのでは、大変な相違がある。それを知らなければいけないよ。でも、本当にあんたは、よくやった。有難うよ」 又、こうも言った。 「人間は、いつでも最悪の場合に処する心構えをもっていれば、何が来ても、どんな境遇に置かれても、びくともしないで済む。いつも順境にあるとは限らないからね、こういう心構えが大事だよ。どうせ人間は、裸で生まれて来たのではないか。ない生命を救って頂いたことを思えば、ご用のためには何をしても足りないのだ。これだけやればもういいということはないのだよ」 先生は、世辞というものが言えなかった。言えるけれど言わない、のではない。言えないのである。性格的に駄目なのであった。 だから、若い娘などは、はじめはどうしても、先生をこわがる。びくびくしている。 中には、触らぬ神にたたりなしとばかり、遠くの方から、そっと見ている娘もあった。 ある人が言った。 「先生はおっかなくて大嫌いだった」 ぎょろりとした目。 こっちがあやふやな気持ちでいる時は、とてもまともには見られない強く光る目。 しかし、先生は、本当は優しいのであった。 時として、先生が、台所にすうっと入って来ることがある。そして、黙って立っている。 そこで働いている人たちは、それに気がつかない。 先生は、その人たちのすることをじっと見ている。 ある時、若い娘が、餅米の入った大きな笊（ざる）を持ち上げかねて、頬を紅潮させてりきんでいた。 先生は、その背後で、それを見ていたが、その若い娘の気合をはかって、 「ヨイショ？」と掛け声をかけた。 笊は持ち上がった。 若い娘は、うしろに立っている先生を見て、泣きたいような嬉しさを感じた。 「こういうところに、先生の優しさがあるのです」とその人は、あとで言った。 三十四 布教のこととなると、先生は夢中であった。 常に、座右に、日本地図を備えて置いて、布教をひろげて行く地域については、あくまでも研究をおこたらなかった。 そして、若い人々を適材適所に使った。学問のあるなし、前歴のよしあし、頭のよしあし、そんなことはどうでもよかった。ただ、これは真面目な人間だと見ると、先生は、どしどし抜適〔擢〕して使った。 ある分会長が、自分の名利のために、若い信者たちをおだてて、とかくの問題を起こしたことがあった。 助手が、見かねて、分会長に忠言した。 すると、分会長は、逆にその助手の悪口を若い信者たちに言う。 とうとう、その助手は、本部に行って、そのことを先生に訴えた。 先生は、言った。 「いいじゃないか、やらせておけ。しかし、そういう空気の中では、君もやりにくいだろうから、おれのところへ来い」 先生が、弟子と弟子とのあいだに溝をつくるような言動をしたことがあった。 しかし、それは、遠大な心組みからであった。十分に粘着していない二人を、本当にぴったりと粘着した二人にするために、一度思い切って、その二人を離す必要がある。先生は、そう考えたのであった。 やがて、まもなく、その弟子たちは堅く結ばれた。そして、教勢も伸びた。 「先生が妙な言動をするものだと思って、その当時、私は私なりに、いろいろと探ってみたのでしたが、先生のその言動の底に、露ほどの憎悪の心は見えませんでした」と、あとになって、その人は言った。 結ぶために、一度、それを切り離す。ちぎっては拡げ、ちぎっては拡げて行く――そういうやり方も、先生はした。 五六七会の参拝日に、先生は、大勢の信者の一番うしろに坐って、彼等の質問などを、じっと聞いていることもあった。五六七会の方は、渋井先生が総宰していて、先生は出る幕ではなかったのであるが、他山の石として話も聞きたいし、空気も見て取って置きたかった。そういう熱心さをもっていた。 「背の高い、和服の人が、そっと来て、信者のうしろの方に坐る。そして、みんなの質問事項を聞いている。そのうちに、いつかその人はいなくなっている。それが、先生でした」と、当時、五六七会の信者であった人が話した。 布教の相談では、しばしば徹夜もした。もやめて呉れるだろうと思っても、先生は、い〔つ〕までも話し続ける。弟子の方が参ってしまうのであった。 「布教には、常に現在があるだけだ。只今即刻だけだ。遅れてはだめだ。布教には、明日はないのだ」 先生は、そう考えていた。 ある時、何かの祝いがあって、二十人程の人が、座敷に坐っていた。膳部もすっかり並べられていた。 その時、一人の若い弟子が、そそくさと入って来た。 「どうも、おそくなりまして……」と若い弟子は、頭をかいた。 すると、先生は、やんわりと言った。 「汽車が出てしまったら、誰も乗せては呉れないよ」 先生は、遅れるということを嫌った。「遅れるということは、嘘をつくということと同じだ」とよく言った。 そして、布教という一大事には、今を措いて明日という日はないと言った。遅れるなと常に言っていた。 三十五 先生は、散歩が好きであった。 いいところを見ておいて、あとで弟子たちを連れて行ってやろうという下心もあって、よく散歩をした。気に入った道は、何度でも歩き、気に入った場所へは、何度でも行った。 箱根参拝のあと、乗りものには乗らず、木賀の渓谷を歩いて帰ることもあった。そういう時は、一人でなく、助手などを連れていた。 先生は、いつも神経をぴーんと張っていた。あまり強く押すと切れてしまう楽器の糸のように、見ていていたいたしいような時もあった。 「おれが、本当にのんびり出来るのは、汽車の中だけだ」とよく言っていた。 しかし、それは、汽車の中ばかりではなかった。自然のふところの中でも、先生は神経の緊張をゆるめることが出来るのが嬉しく、如何にも悠々と見えた。 特に、花が好きであった。道で見る花は、木の花でも、草の花でもよく見た。何となく通り過ぎてしまうということはなかった。平凡だと思われる花も、詩人の目でしっかりと見ていた。 「熱海の桜の美しさ――それを私は、先生から説明されて、見直すことが出来ましたよ。それまでは、桜は何処も同じものだと思っていましたがね」とある弟子は語っている。 「花は、天国の象徴の一つです。家庭の各部屋、さては便所の手洗い場にまで花が飾ってあったら、どんなに美しく、和やかでしょう。どの家庭も最初から天国というわけには行かないが、そういう心掛けによって、だんだん家庭天国に近づいて行くことが出来るのです。美の普遍化として、簡単に、費用と時間を要しない花の大衆化が必要です。日本の気候風土および日本人の特質を利用しての高級花の輸出という国策の面もありますが、私どもはまず、食糧増産に支障をきたさない限り、寸土も花壇として、手近に、廉価に各家庭を花で飾ろうではありませんか」 戦後、まだ三年、人心も落ちつかない時に、先生はこういう話を、しばしば信者にした。 昭和二十年の秋、大先生の供をして、先生はじめ総勢二十七人で、十国峠まで出かけたことがあった。 大先生は、モンペに尻っぱしょりという姿。その他のめんめんも、それぞれ相当の格好をして、それでも往路はバスで行った。 帰途は、みんな熱海まで歩いて下ったが、その時、大先生は、 「うん、ここはいい」と、今の瑞雲郷を買う決心をされた。 この時ばかりではなく、先生は天気さえよければ、大先生の随行者として、よくあちこちへ土地探しに歩いた。 そういう目的がなくとも、歩くことが好きであるから、暇をみては歩いた。 三十六 先生は、とっつきのいい人ではなかった。 初対面の人などに、一体おまえさんは誰なのかね、というような顔をしている時もあった。 それに、人を扱う要領も下手であった。まだよく知らない相手にむかっても、のっけから議論を吹っかける。相手は、いい気持ちがしない。 ある時、初めて先生にあった人が、先生と議論した。こういう場合、一般に先生といわれる人は、適当にあしらって、「じゃ、又来なさい」と柔らかくその人を帰らせる方法を取るものであるが、先生には、そういう芸当は出来ない。Ｍさんという初対面の相手と真正面からぶつかった。 Ｍさんも、後へ引き下がるような男ではない。議論は、だんだん激しくなって、とうとう先生の口調は喧嘩越し〔腰〕になって来た。Ｍさんも負けてはいず、言いたいだけ言った。議論だか、喧嘩だか、わからなくなった。 （四十男を赤んぼ扱いしやがる） Ｍさんは、もう二度と会うものかと思って、ぷんぷんして帰っていった。 しかし、翌日になると、どういうものか又会いたくなり、懐かしくさえなって、先生を訪ねた。 「君は何も知らないじゃないか」 先生は、そう言って、たっぷり二時間、Ｍさんに、神について講釈した。その顔は、熱情に満ち満ちていた。昨日のことなんか、もう胸の何処にもないような虚心淡〔坦〕懐な態度であった。 Ｍさんは、それですっかり先生が気に入り、やがてそれは尊敬となり、推服となって、信者となった。のちには分会長となった。 先生は、正直であった。正直過ぎると言った方がいい。 ある人が、先生に連れられて、大先生の前に出た。その人は、浄霊を始めたばかりだった。 その前に、その人は、先生から、 「今日は、何でも大先生にお願いしなさい」と言われていた。 そこで、その人は浄霊しても治らなかった事例だけを言って、 「何か私にまちがったところがあるのでしょうか」と伺いを立てた。 大先生は、それについて、いろいろと説いた。先生は、その側で、（なんていうことだ、失敗話ばかり並べ立てて）と渋い顔をしていた。 あとで、先生は、その男に言った。 「何故あんなことばかり報告したのだ」 「でも先生は、なんでも遠慮なくお願いしていいと言われたから、その通りにしたのです」 「なんでも正直に言えば、それでいいと考えているのか。今日は帰ってはいかん。家へ来なさい。話して聞かせることがある」 そう言って、先生は、その人を自宅へ連れて行き、夜通し説教した。 「治ったことを有難いと思えば、それでいいのだ。神様は、見通しだ。くどくどと文句を言うことはないのだ。治ったところだけを感謝すればいいのだ」 先生には、こういう正直なところがあった。その正直さは、むしろ可愛いと言った方がいいだろう。幼いと言った方がいいかもしれない。「いつも正直にいえばいいと思うか」などと人には言いながら、いつも正直に言っていて、得もしたけれど損もしていたのが先生であった。 初対面の人に、ぶっきらぼうな言動をしたということも、意識して、そういう姿勢をとり、威張って見せるというのではない。興味がないから、自然そうなるというだけであった。 ある若い助手が、先生から叱られて、 「先生に叱られて嬉しかった」とその気持ちを同僚に言った。 それを聞いて、先生は、正直に言った。 「牛は叩かれると、気持ちがいいものだ。しかし、それは嬉しいのとは違う。叱られて嬉しいというのはへんだ。それは本物じゃない。叱られて、あとがせいせいしたというのならわかるが、嬉しいというのはどうかな」 先生ぐらい、殆ど傍若無人に、人を叱った人もすくなくないであろうが、それでいながら、叱られる人の心理も、ちゃんと知っていたのであった。 知っていて、容赦なく叱った。時には、相手の目玉が飛び出る程に叱った。 ただ、亡くなる一年ぐらい前から、あまり叱らなくなった。 「講話の最中に居眠りをしている者があっても叱らなくなったのは、昇天一年ぐらい前からです」と一弟子は述懐している。 とにかく、正直な先生であった。 人にも、自分にも、嘘のつけない人であった。 三十七 先生は、よく人を叱ったが、その先生もまた、大先生から、よく叱られた。 ある時、先生はじめ幹部の人たちが、東山荘に集っていた。そして、大先生を中心に、重要な問題を相談していた。 その時、先生の家のそばが火事だという。 「中島。すぐ帰りなさい」と大先生は言った。 地震、雷、火事、なんとかという言葉があるが、先生は、そういう天災、人災に、普通以上の恐怖心を持っている人であった。避雷針を立てろと、よく言った。 だから、近所が火事だと聞いて、先生は、飛んで帰った。 しかし、幸いにも、まもなく火は消えて、家にはなんの被害もなくすんだ。 安堵の胸を撫で下ろした先生は、近くから火が出たのに、何故すぐ知らせてよこさなかったのかと、留守居の人を叱りつけた。 「おれは、火事のことを、ほかの人から聞いて帰って来たんだ。留守を預っていながら、おまえは何故電話をかけて来なかったんだ。そんなことでどうするか」 先生の語気は、強かった。 ところが、先生も、自分の家の無事だったことを、すぐ大先生に知らせることを忘れてしまった。上手の手から水が漏れた。 そのため、今度は、先生が、大先生から叱られた。 「わしは随分心配していたのだ。焼けずにすんだのは幸いだが、それをなぜすぐ知らせて呉れないのだ」 そのとばっちりで、当分、弟子たちは、先生から、こう言われた。 「おまえたちが、のろまなんだ。大体、のろまなのは、おまえたちだぞ」 しかし、先生は、素直にあやまることの出来た人であった。 大先生に、あることで叱られて、素直に詫びて戻って来た先生は、弟子たちに、もう一度詫びた。 「私が悪かったのだよ」 ある青年が、先生の家に寝泊りして、教えを受けていた。 その青年が、明日は帰るという前の日、先生は、その人を呼んで言った。 「君は、何か面白くないことがあるらしいが、それを何故直接、私に言わないのだ」 「それは、これこれ、こういうわけです。だから黙っていました」 「そうか。それは私が悪かった」と、先生は素直にあやまった。 三十八 先生は、折り目の正しい人であった。 何かのことでいら立って、畳針で自分の頭を突き刺したこともあるくらい激情的な性格ではあったが、折り目は正しくしていた。からだごとどしんとぶつかって行く人であったが、そうかと言って、八方破れの構えなど出来る人ではなかった。また、しようとはしなかった。いつも、ある程度の威儀を正すことを忘れなかった。 例えば、浄霊をして、病人を治すと、そのあと先生は、必ず大先生にお礼に行った。 東山荘の参拝の日であった。 先生は、大先生に、 「Ｙをお救い下さいまして、有難うございます」と言うなり、涙をぽろぽろ落とした。 大先生は、うしろに坐っている男を見て、 「Ｍ。おまえも治ったか」と訊いた。 その時も、先生は、そのＭと一緒に頭を下げて、心からお礼を言った。まだ、頬に、涙が光っていた。 大先生が絹の時は、先生は木綿を着た。 「大先生が木綿なら、自分は紙を着る」と先生は言った。 これも、先生の「折り目」である。 神は順序なりということも、先生にとっては、厳粛な折り目であった。 だから、布教上の報告ということについては、先生は、非常にやかましかった。 ある分会長が、結婚の媒酌人を頼まれたことがあった。 その日、結婚式場へ行かなければならなかったので、布教上の報告を助手に頼んで、出かけた。 命令された通り、助手はその報告を、先生に差し出したのであるが、先生にはそれが気に入らなかった。 翌日、その分会長が、先生のところへ行くと、先生は大立腹であった。 「それからというものは、私は、絶対に媒酌はやらないことに決めたのです。そういうことで報告がおろそかになると、又々先生から怒鳴りつけられますからね。とにかく、先生は、折り目、折り目をきちんとしないと怒りましたね。それくらいだから、先生自身は、いつも折り目正しくしていましたよ。少なくとも、カミシモを着る時は、ちゃんと着ていましたね」 その分会長は、こりたという顔をして、こう言っていた。 折り目が正しいということは、言い換えれば、あいまいさが嫌いということである。 自分の心があいまいな時は、誰も先生の顔をまともには見られなかった。その大きな目が恐ろしかった。 先生には、誰も嘘をつく気にはなれなかったが、それよりも、誰も嘘をつくことが出来なかった。自然、正直になった。 先生も、嘘はつかなかった。いや、つこうと思っても、つけない人なのであった。まるで子供のように、底抜けに正直であった。 「相手の身になって考えろ」 先生は、よくこう言った。 箱根の参拝日。その日は、雨だった。 若い助手のＢさんは、熱海の本部を出る時、誰かの傘を借りて出かけた。 さて、用事が終って、帰り道で気がつくと、自分の持っている傘に、「中島」と書いてある。 （あっ。先生の傘だ。まちがわないように、ちゃんと傘立に傘を置いといたのに、これは又どうしたまちがいだろうか。弱ったな。だが、これは、自分のほうでまちがえたのではない。誰かがまちがえたのだ） Ｂさんは、そう自分の心に言いきかせた。 そして、そのまま熱海へ帰って来た。 あとから戻って来た先生は、傘立に自分の傘がないので、他の人の傘を借りて来たと言った。 Ｂさんは、首をすくめて、 「傘をまちがえたのは、私です。どうもすみませんでした」とあやまった。 すると、先生は、「おまえには、誠がない」と言って、奥へ入って行った。 （誠がない？それは、どういう意味だろうか） Ｂさんは、いろいろ考えてみた。しかし、どうもよくその意味がつかめなかった。 一カ月ぐらい考えた。そして、やっとわかった。 「私が傘をまちがえて持ってきてしまったため、先生がその傘を探す時間だけ、それだけ先生の時間を無駄にさせてしまったのですね。先生の時間は、大事な時間で、言うならば神様の時間です。それを知っていながら、まちがえた傘をさして、そのまま箱根から熱海まで帰って来てしまったのです。まちがったと知ったら、何故箱根で、先生にその傘を渡さなかったのだろうと思って、自分の至らないのが恥かしくなりました。先生に、大事な神様の時間を無駄にさせてしまって……ああ、誠がないとはこのことだなと、やっと気がついたわけでした」 Ｂさんは、こう言ってから、 「先生は、その場で説明してしまわないで、あとで本人によく考えさせるという手を使う人でした」とつけた。 先生が、大勢の信者を前にして、話をする。 すると、信者の一人一人が、これは特に私だけに下さる教えだと思う。 これも、先生が、「相手の身になって考える」人であったからであろう。 三十九 「おれは、人をつくるのだ」 これが、先生の信念であった。 先生は、どんな人にも、どんな時にも、全力を出して道を説いた。 このことは、捕らえられて獄にあった吉田松陰が、獄の格子の向こうにいる獄卒に、じゅんじゅんと道を説いたという――その話を思い出させる。 そして、先生は、人を教える時には、時間もなにも忘れた。 「本当の話はこれからだ」と先生が言うので、時計を見たら、真夜中の十二時。そういうことが、しばしばあった。 だから、終るのが明け方の三時、四時になることも珍しくなかった。教えるなら、トコトンまで教える。そのため、あまり一生懸命になって、却って誤解されるということもあった。 弟子たちを集めて、三日も徹夜で説きつづけたこともあった。 昼間は忙しく飛び歩き、用事が片づくと、それから話を始める。そして、夜を徹して話し続け、雨戸のすきから朝日がさし込んで来るまでやめない。 弟子たちは、一人残らずグロッキーになってしまう。先生は、平気な顔をしていた。 ある人に嫁を世話したいという話があった。貰おうか、どうしようかと迷っていた。 すると、仲人が、 「その娘は、一年間、中島先生のところで働いていました」と言った。 その人は、その一言で、娘を貰うことに決めた。 「一年間も、先生のところで働いていれば、無条件で貰えますよ」とその人は、あとで同じ信者に言った。 「先生のところにいると、みんな人間が変ってしまう。先生は、人間改造の名人でしたね」と言った人もある。 まことに、先生には、ぼんやり話すということはなかった。ぼんやり読むということもなかった。 何事にも真剣、全力であった。 その気魂と情熱で、人をつくって行った。 しかし、先生は、決して雄弁ではなかった。むしろ、咄〔拙〕弁のほうであった。けれども、そのとつとつとして話す、その話しの魅力は、たいしたものであった。いつのまにか、みんな引きずり込まれてしまうのであった。 人をつくるために、先生は、あらゆる手を用いた。炭のつぎ方、醤油の使い方まで、その材料となった。 「神様のご用をするということは、それは大変なことなのだ、茶碗一つ片づけることだって、仇おろそかには出来ないのだ」 台所仕事などはつまらないと考えていたある女に、先生は、こう言った。 昭和二十二年のある日。復員してきたＤさんは、本部の光明の間の入口のところに坐って、先生の顔をまたたきもしないで見守っていた。軍隊にいた時と同じように、相手から目をそらすと叱られると考えて、じっと穴のあくほど見つめていた。 その時、一人の娘が、茶を持って入って来た。しかし、先生の顔を見守っているＤさんは、それに気がつかない。 入口で、娘はもじもじしている。 それを見た先生は、Ｄさんを指して言った。 「入口に坐っている人間は、出世しない。出入りの邪魔になることが気がつかない人間だからだ。人は始終あたりに気を配っていなくてはならない」 勿論、Ｄさんは、顔を赤くして縮まってしまった。 「信仰の目的は、完全な人間になるために、一歩一歩修養を積んで行くいことだ。それには、常に謙虚であり、親切であり、社会の幸福を願う下座の業を積んで行かなければならない」 こう先生は、言っていた。 口で教えるばかりではなく、先生は、せっせと原稿を書いた。すこしの暇でもあると、書いていた。真夏でも、汗を垂らし垂らし書いた。信者から沢山の手紙が来るが、書けるだけは、その返事を書くように努めた。 しかし、いちいち全部の返事は、到底書いていられない。と言って、受け取ったということぐらいは知らせたい。 そこで、先生は葉書に、毛筆で「真」の一字を書き、その下に「一斎」と書いたものを幾枚も書き溜めて置いて、それを、「手紙見た」という返事として出すのであった。 忙しくて、新聞を読む時間もないことが多い。そういう時、先生は見出しの上にシルシをつけて置いて、夜おそくなってから、助手に読んで貰った。 寝るのは、早くて十二時。遅い時は、二時、三時ということも珍らしくなかった。 四十 昭和十六年六月三十日。 先生は、大先生のお供をして、伊勢神宮に参拝した。 出発の前、大先生は、 「中島、おまえは和服ばかり着ているが、今度は洋服を着て行けよ。和服ならわしは一緒に行かんぞ」と笑いながら言った。 このため、先生は、どうしても洋服を着て行かなければならない羽目になった。 ところが、その洋服がない。 買おうと思っても、先生は背が高いから既製服では体に合うのがない。新しく仕立てさせる時間はない。 仕方なく、そのままを白状したら、大先生はやっぱり笑った。 「では、おまえは和服で行け。わしは飽くまで洋服だぞ」 さて、長い汽車の旅の中で、初めて大先生の碁の相手をした。 この時、どっちがどれだけ勝ったかは、誰も知らない。しかし、負けることの大嫌いな二人――六十才の大先生と、四十三才の先生とが喧嘩にもならず、めでたく参拝を済ませ、帰途長良川の鵜飼を楽しんだことを思えば、おそらく車中の戦いは、同点引き分けになったのだろう。 というのは、この時の手合わせが最初で、それからは毎年正月に、大先生と先生との勝負が行われたのであるが、いつも手合わせは二番だけにきまっていた。 その理由は、先生のほうが少しばかり強く、かといって二勝しては、大先生の機嫌が悪くなるだろうし、負けるのはいやだし、結局、一勝一敗ということにして、初春の大手合せはめでたく終るという寸法であった。 先生が、大先生に対して闘志を燃やすのは、たった一つ、碁の時だけであった。 四十一 先生の頭は、鼠花火のように、クルクルまわる頭であった。 考えが、先へ先へと行く。しかもそれが早い。まるで電流のようであった。 話していると、 「その次は、どうするんだ」と畳みかけて来る。 もぐもぐしていると、 「こうするつもりなんだろう」とすぐ二の矢が飛んで来る。 せっかちでもあった。 だから、話がよく飛躍する。 よほどしっかりしていないと、ついて行けない。迷子にされてしまう。 先生が、折にふれ、時に応じて語った言葉の中から、流星のような言葉――言い換えれば、素晴しい光を放っているのだが、よく気をつけて見ていないと見失ってしまうような飛躍した言葉を拾ってみる。 ある時。 「ドブに落ちている沢庵をとって来い。はっ。取って来ます。――これが兵隊だよ」 ある時。 「主師親ということを知っているか。主は応身弥勒で、大先生。師は法身弥勒で、出口王仁三郎。親は報身弥勒で、出口直先生だ」 ある時。 「ミロクの世は、いつ出来ますか」とある人が訊いた。 「昭和百年」と先生は言下に答えた。 ある時。 「天国会は、神性人間を造り出すところだ。動物人間は、住めない」 ある時。 はじめて会った人に、 「人間は誰がつくったか、知っているか」 「はあ。造物主です」 「薬は毒だが、知っているか」 「体験で知っています」 「おまえは、なかなかえらい」 ある時。 「先生だって、お守りをはずせば同じじゃないかと、あいつが言ったよ。あはははは」 ある時。 「マッチになれ」 物を燃やそうと思って、ただマッチを持って行ってもだめである。箱の中の軸木を燃やさなければならない。燃えた軸木は、どんなものをも燃やすことが出来る。人を燃やし、人を感激させるのも同じことで、まず自分が燃えて初めて可能となる。 ある時。 「風呂から上って身仕舞いをする時の気持」 先生は、女性の身嗜みについて、こう言った。この時の気持を持ち続けることが大切で、身嗜みの心構えは、この一言に尽きると言っている。 ある時。 「信仰に入っても一番になれ、そうかと言って、信仰は事業ではないのだから、魂の曇りをなくする以外に、その道はない」 ある時。 先生は、弟子たちに、宗教家としての素質があるかどうかを見分ける方法を知っているかと質問しておいて、こう言った。 「一番簡単で狂わない方法は、その人間に理想があるかないかを見ることだ。そして、次に、矛盾した世の中を見て、善悪がわかる人間であるかどうかを確かめてみることだ。その上、同情心があれば、まず大丈夫だ」 ある時。 「教師にとって一番の身魂磨きは、金と男女問題だから、それに打ち勝っていかなければならない」 終りに、一言つけ加えておく、 先生は、「教えの人」であったが、その前に「行の人」であった。きびしい修業の人であった。 このことをはっきり知っておかないと、教えの人としての先生が、ただ単に神経質な先生という印象を受け易い。 四十二 先生は、美男子であった。 瀟洒な和服が、よく似合った。 誰でもすぐ、役者を連想した。 「まさに団十郎だね」と一人の弟子が言う。 「君は団十郎を見たのか」と他の弟子が訊く。 「勿論、見ているはずはないじゃないか。しかし、とにかく団十郎だよ」 「何処が団十郎なんだ」 「君も錦絵の初代団十郎は見たことがあるだろう。あれとそっくりだ」 「そうかなあ」 「そうだとも。第一、あの目を見ろ。団十郎が目玉をむいたのと寸分違わないよ」 「先生は、いつも目をむいているわけではない」 「むいていなくても、団十郎が目玉をむいたのと同じなんだ。凄いじゃないか」 先生は、こういう内緒話を、直接耳にしたことはないかも知れない。しかし美男子であるということは、多少とも自認していたのではなかったろうか。何故なら、先生は、すべてにおいて、自信の人であったから。 その先生は、フェミニストであった。 我が強くて、横暴と見える亭主の先生も、結局はフェミニストであった。夫人には、一目も二目も置いていた。甘えん坊のようなところもあった。 何かに腹を立てて、ぷりぷりしていても、 「そんなに怒らないでもいいでしょ」と夫人になだめられると、先生の顔に、甘ったれ小僧のような表情が出て来る。 それで、夕立のあとのように、立腹も一巻の終りということがしばしばであった。 「先生は、奥さんに甘ったれている」と言った弟子もいた。 いや、怒って見せることも、実は、先生の甘ったれの表情であったかもしれない。 晩年、ようやく落ち着いた生活の中で、少量の晩酌を楽しむゆとりも出来てきた。 いかにもおいしそうに飲んだ。 しかし、時には、飲みたくないこともある。 「今夜は、いらないよ」と先生は、前もって夫人に言う。 それを夫人は、台所の手伝いに伝えるのを忘れる。 だから、晩の膳の上には、ちゃんと徳利が載せてある。 すると、先生は怒る。 「酒はいらぬと言ったじゃないか」 「そうでしたね、お台所の人に言うのを忘れました」 「おまえが悪いんだ。この酒、おまえがみんな飲んでしまえ」 こういう怒り方をするのは、一種の甘ったれ心理である。このことをよく知っていた当時の分会長が、笑いながら言った。 「内側はどうか知らないが、外側は模範的な夫婦だったという人があるが、私はその逆だよ。外側はどうか知らないが、内側は実に模範的な夫婦だったと思っている。しかし、これは、夫も妻も模範的な人間だからそうだったといっているのではない。お互いに弱点は持っていながら、その弱点と弱点とがぎしぎし軋しり合わずに、具合よく歯車のように噛み合って廻る――そういったよい夫婦だったと思う」 フェミニストであったから、女の信者、弟子達には、当然人気があった。それに、美男子なのであるから、人気がなかったら、それこそ不思議というものであろう。 ある時、手伝いの娘が、先生のお供をして関西へ行くことになった。 ちょうどその時、娘の友達が、やはり関西へ行くことになった。 「先生と一緒じゃ、窮屈だわ。あなたと二人、ロマンス・シートで行きたい」と娘は、その友人に言った。 このひそひそ話を、先生は聞いたかも知れないし、聞かなかったかも知れない。 先生は、その娘の友達の女に言った。 「あんただけ、先に行きなさい」 ただ、それだけ言っただけで、手伝いの娘には、なんとも言わなかった。 それが男の弟子だったら、「一緒に行きたくなければ、行くな」ぐらいの雷は落ちたにちがいない。 玉川署に留置されて、一週間目に家へ帰った先生は、出迎えた夫人に、 「どうやって食っていた？」と訊いた。 「なんとか食べていました」と言うと、 「そうか」 それっきりであった。 その先生が、便所の前で、抜けかかったパンツの紐を通して貰っている。そういう子供みたいな、愛すべき夫でもあった。 先生は、こう言った。 「人を許しましょう。相応の理ということがあって、皆、自分にふさわしい妻であり、子である。妻子を叱り飛ばす前に、一応反省しましょう。自分にも、非はあり過ぎる程あるのだ。反省と寛容、そして共に身魂を磨いてゆく――家庭の天国化は、ここに始まる」 機嫌のいい時、先生が、夫人に、 「浮気でもしてみるかな」と冗談を言う。 すると、夫人は、 「私よりいい人がいたら、いつでも遊びに行ってらっしゃい」と答える。 そして、あとは大笑いになる。 いい夫婦であった。 四十三 先生は、手紙や原稿など、すべて毛筆で書いた。 書は好きだったらしい。しかし、先生の書を、うまいという人と、むしろ下手だったという人と、半分ぐらいずつある。 ある人が、 「要するに、面白い書だよ」と言ったが、この批評が一番ぴったりしている。 短歌を、よく作った。 昭和二十四年の九月から十二月までに三冊、天国会の会報として、「天国之友」という雑誌を発行したが、それには毎号、短歌が載せてある。 今はしも滅びんとする世をあはれみて、出でましにけり救いの君はも。 師の君の御救ひなくば崩れ行く、此の日の本は如何になるらん。 夜の終りはや近めるを知らぬげに、赤のみたまの騒がしきかも。 次々に忌はしき事のみ重なるは、夜の終りの徴なりけり。 厳かな神の審判は今正に、現はれ初めけり心せよかし。 師の君の隠せる力を知りてより、凡てを捨てて我は起ちたり。 師の君の振はせ給ふ御力は、神の救ひの力と覚れり。 師の君を我若し未だ知らざれば、迷ひに迷ひ悩みつづけむ。 師の君の御力戴き吾も亦、力限りに世人医さむ。 師の君の御身のまはりの出来事は、みな大神の仕組と知れかし。 霊界の転換いよよ吾等住む、此の地の上に移り初めけり。 五と六に七の力の加はりて、絶対力は現れなんとすも。 十全の御力戴き思ふまま、世人救ふ時は近めり。 奴羽玉の闇に染まりし此の身魂、洗い浄めて神業に仕へん。 風水火三大災厄何んのその、身魂磨きて神に縋れば。 大神は正しき人に造らんと、曲とう砥石を吾に賜へり。 ある日、先生が、自作の短歌を大先生に差し出すと、大先生は笑って、 「きみのは、歌じゃないよ。漢文だよ」と笑って言った。もちろん、半分冗談であろう。 けれども、この言葉は、先生の短歌に対する批評というだけでなく、もっと大きな意味をもっている。 というのは、先生の性格には、漢文のようなところがあった。 これについて、ある人は、 「先生の故郷の土地柄だね。松陰と似ているんだ」と言った。 又、ある人は、 「遺伝かもしれない。父君は漢詩人だったし、日本外史が愛読書だったからね」と言った。 四十四 「自分にもきびしく、人にもきびしい。私は、先生を道元のような人と思った」 昭和二十四年秋、先生に初めて会ったある宗教学者が言っている。 先生は、確かに、そういう秋霜烈日のような人であった。古武士の面影があった。 しかし、一方、ユーモラスなところもあった。 ある時、ある分教会で、先生を招いて講話を聞いた。二百人ぐらい信者が集っていた。 講話が終って、先生は、演壇をはなれ、部屋から出て行こうとした。 すると、遅れて来て、一番うしろの席に坐っていた一人の娘が、 「先生。もっとよくお顔を見せて下さい」と大きな声で言った。 先生は、それを聞くと、再び演壇近くまで戻って来て、ちょっとシナをつくってみせた。 そして、こう言った。 「あたし、はずかしいわ」 こういう先生でもあったから、面白いことは遠慮なく笑った。いかにも愉快そうに、大きな口をあけて笑った。取り済〔澄〕ました顔ばかりしていなかった。 旅の列車の中で、ある人が、落語を一席やった。 先生は、腹をかかえて笑いこけた。 あとで、自分が大きな声で笑い続けたことが、ちょっとテレ臭くなったのだろう。にやりとして言った。 「しようのないやつだ」 毎月、本部に集った時に、分会の会長たちは、御讃歌の朗唱を練習する。 ある日、分会長の代理で、Ｗさんという助手が、それに出た。 出たけれども、自分は分会長ではなし、朗唱はしなくてもいいのだろうと思って、のんびり坐っていた。 ところが、先生は、 「君もやれ」と言う。 Ｗさんは、あわてた。どういう節でやっていいのかわからない。 思い切って、自分流で、朗唱し出した。 その節があまりにおもしろいので、先生は大きな声で笑った。他の連中も、どっと笑った。 それだけではない。Ｗさんの滑稽な節に感染して、あとからあとから、妙な節の朗唱が出た。 先生は、面白がって、あっはっはと笑っていた。 ある時、助手が、紙幣を重ねて、それに帯をして、何万何千円と書いた。 ところが、まちがって、千の位のところに点を打たず、百の位のところに点を打ってしまった。 それを見て、先生は、おどけて言った。 「随分沢山あるね。これは凄い！」 「お茶の作法だけはだめでした」と夫人が言っているが、先生は、なんでもやった。その先生のお得意なものに百人一首があった。 恒例として、毎年正月には、かるた会が開かれ、大先生を中心に、先生やその助手、あるいはその他の信者などが集って、賑やかなことであった。 しかし、その手並みでは、先生がズバ抜けてうまい。だから、先生の前に坐った者は、例外なく散々に負かされる。入れ替り、立ち替り、総なめにされることも多かった。 大先生も笑って、 「上の句は読まんこったな。でないと、中島にみんなとられてしまう」と言った。 他の連中は、大抵、読み手が下の句まで読んで来ないと、手も出ないのであった。 笑い冠句も盛んに作った。 大先生が宗匠格で、その笑い冠句の会は、昭和四年頃から八年頃まで続いた。 昼の弁当には、いつも、竹の皮に包んだ赤飯が出た。 先生の号が千成、夫人の号が万女子。 時には、子供たちとゲームをすることがあった。負けると、本気でくやしがった。 ピンポンをやる時でも、肌ぬぎになって、すぐムキになる。勝つまでやめない。勝てば、ご機嫌であった。 先生は、夕食のあとなど、ピアノを弾いて楽しむこともあった。「米山さんから、雲が出て……」というのが好きで、こればかりをよく弾いた。「金襴どんすの帯しめながら……」という童謡も好きだった。時には、長唄の「越後獅子」を弾く事もあった。 「どうだ。うまいものだろう」 ある人に、そう自慢してみせたら、その口の悪い男は、 「しかし、先生のはやっぱりお茶漬けピアノですね」と言った。 先生は、音楽を知らない者が何を言うかというような顔をした。 そのピアノは、戦時中、東京から買って来た。熱海まで自動車で運ぶのであるが、そのガソリンは自分で心配して調達して来た。 ピアノは、まあ及第点であったが、歌うことはカラキシだめであった。音痴の部類であった。 御讃歌の奉誦も、先生はよく側の夫人に、 「おまえ、やれよ」と言った。 そういう先生であるから、自分から歌うなどということは殆どなかった。ただ、宴会の余興などの時に、「愛染かつら」だけはよく歌った。 しかも、歌う時には、わざと中風患者の格好をして、そしていかにもロレツがまわらないという口振りで、それを歌うのであった 「先生は、歌が下手なことを百も承知しているから、それで、ああやってカムフラージュして歌うんだね」と弟子の一人が、隣の席の男に言った。 「そこが、先生の悧巧なところだ」とその男が答えた。 けれども、聞くことは好きだった。 夫人が琴を弾くのを、先生はいつも静かに、じっと聞いていた。特に「千鳥の曲」が好きであった。 先生と夫人の笑い冠句と沓句を載せて置こう。 チェッ、何が華族だ祖先は盗賊じゃねえか。（千成） 助けてくれえ、とは貧乏人じゃねえ三井、三菱様だよ。 ああたまらねえ、税金がたまらねえ。 ああたまらねえ、と助けを求める金持の後家さんはいないものかな。 ああたまらねえ、ほど溜るのは罪と、そうして便所だよ。 アン畜生、人を責める時はいい気持そう、自分が責められる時は居睡り。 奇妙奇天烈、神様にかかって助かるよりは、医者にかかって死ぬ方がマシだとよ。 妾恥しいわ、何ていう柄かい、まるで鬼子母神のような面をしやがって。 妾恥しいわ、随分目立って来たのよ、腹膜炎かしら。 フヌケ、フヌケって馬鹿にするが、これでも女房を家に囲ってあるんだぞ、ヘン。 ソーラ大変、隣の夫婦が夜中に大喧嘩だ、アアいい気持だとホクソ笑んでる独り者。 寒中胸も足も丸出しの洋装美人、続け様に、ハックショイ。（万女子） トンチキ野郎、酒と酢とを間違えて、ヤー大変。 顔形は、ヘナチョコ野郎の亭主でも、心はナカナカもって、ホホホホ。 奥様、女中にあんまりお小言がうるさいので、女中思わず、このスベタめ。 四十五 「気の利く人間になれ」 先生は、よくこう言った。 昭和二十三年。戦争が終って三年になっていたが、まだ国内の治安も十分でなく、人々は信ずるより疑う方が得だという気持で、荒れた毎日を過していた。 気の利く人間とは、要するにずるい人間のことだと思い、あまりこの言葉の値打もないような時世だった。 しかし、集る信者たちに、先生はいつもこの言葉を繰り返した。 ある時、遠い地方からの信者が集る日なのに、夜来の雨がその朝になってもやまず、びしょびしょと降り続いている。――そういう日であった。 やがて、時刻が来て、熱海駅から大勢の信者が濡れ鼠になって入って来た。 遠い地方から来た人たちなので、誰も雨具の用意はしていなかった。ずぶ濡れの信者たちを見ても、受付の人は、気の毒にとは思いつつも、駅に傘を持って迎えに行かなかったことを別に不親切だったとも考えなかった。 あとで、助手たちに、先生は言った。 「皆、遠いところから、夜通し汽車に揺られて来るのは、なんのためか。お光をいただいて、少しでも向上し、世界人類を可能な限り救おうとされる神の意志に添って、地上天国の建設のための一役をしたいという念願に燃えているからではないか。又、君たちは、その人々の誠のしるしとして持って来たものを、それぞれ頂いているではないか。それなのに、君たちは、濡れて来た信者を見て気の毒だと思うだけで、誰も駅まで傘を持って行かなかった。いや、傘を持って行くべきだと考えた者もいなかったのだろう。よくよく反省しなければいけない。私がいつもいう気の利く人間とは、親切な人間ということだ。不親切だが気が利く人間なんていうものには、私は用はない」 先生の審判は、きびしいものであった。 と言って先生は、あまり気の利き過ぎる人間は嫌いであった。 「気の利かないやつと、気の利き過ぎるやつ。おれは、どっちも嫌いだ」と言っていた。 この言葉は、信者の中でも、よくその意味がわからない者が多かったようである。 しかし、先生の言わんとするところは、気が利き過ぎるということは、親切ということの反対の場合が多いということであったろう。 先生は、こう言った。 「気が利くということと、感謝の気持とは、一つなのだ。感謝の気持がなく、ただ気を利かそうと思って気を利かせる――これは本物ではない」 先生は、下座の行ということを、いつもくどい程言っていた、 「人間失敗の原因の一つは、威張るということだ。本当の成功者は、決して昔を忘れない。昔を忘れて、矯〔驕〕りたかぶることは、失敗の第一歩である。神の前に、人間の地位、身分の高下がなんになろう。常に、謙譲でなければならない。下座のこころをわすれてはならない」 「信仰者にとって、一番大切なことは常に下座の行を忘れないことである。私どもが大きな観音力をいただいて、自分にすら思いがけない奇蹟が次々にあらわれ、人々から生神様のように尊敬されると、ともすれば、自分を実質以上に価値づけて、思い上がってしまうことがなきにしもあらずである。そして、思い上がって自己反省を忘れて来ると、それからは何もかも神様の道からはずれてしまい、しかもそれに気づかないという二重の間違いを起す。そして、最後には、みじめにも奈落に転落してしまう。よくよく気をつけなければならない」 「信仰の道は、完全な人間となるために、一歩一歩修養を積んで行くこと以外にない。それには、常に謙譲でなければならない」 「こころは常に新しく」 先生は、常にそう言っていた。 亡くなる三カ月程前、先生は、信者たちに説いて聞かせた。 「私たちは、今、だんだんと白米を食べられるようになった。戦争中は、馬も食わぬような豆粕なども食べて、白米の有難さを、しみじみと感じていた。農家でもないのに、今年の収穫はどうだろうか、二百十日は大丈夫だろうか、害虫の被害はありはしないかと、雨につけ、風につけ、心配して、農家の労苦に感謝していた。それが、この頃になって、白米も次第に豊富に出廻って来ると、つい昨日までの感謝を忘れて、ぞんざいにする。 健康についても、そうである。医者にかかり、薬を浴びる程のんでも、その他、百方手を尽くしても治らなかった。前途暗澹たるものがあった。それが、ふとしたことからこの道によって救われ、見違えるような丈夫な体になる。涙が出る程、嬉しく、いつかこの御恩報じをしなければならないと考える。それが、日がたつにつれて、いつか昔を忘れ、感謝の気持も消え失せて、傲慢不遜になる。 信仰についても、そうである。信仰の道に入った当座は、有難さ、尊さ、勿体なさを感じて、心は火のように燃えていた。それが、時のたつに従って、いつのまにか怠慢になり、形式主義になり、初めの感謝を忘れてしまう。 これらはすべて、心を新しくすることをしないからだ。 人は、信仰を口にする。しかし、その信仰に対して、自分を反省して行く人は、果して幾人あるだろうか。常に、入信当時の心を忘れず、その心が古くならないよう、今日よりは明日、明日よりは明後日と、自分の心に鞭を打って行かねばならない。流れない水は、腐る。自ら鞭うたない心は、やがて弾力を失う。心を常に新しく――これを忘れないで貰いたい」 四十六 昭和二十四年の秋、法務府のＯ氏は、箱根に出張し、旅館の一室で、先生を待っていた。 その頃、法務府は、いわゆる新興宗教の調査に当っていた。Ｏ氏は、その係りであった。 やがて、先生が入って来た。 そして、Ｏ氏にむかって、真正面から、宗教論を吹っかけた。 とうとうと説き出し、説き来り、「うちの宗教こそ最高である」と、その意気当るべからざるものがあった。 Ｏ氏は、印度哲学を専攻した学者であり、言いたいことは山ほどあったが、調査という仕事で来ている身であり、静かに傾聴していた。うなづける点もあり、うなづけない点もあった。 「では、浄霊の実際を見て貰いましょう」 最後に、先生は、そう言った。 そして、人を呼んで、次の部屋に坐らせた。そして、そのあいだの襖を締め切った。だから、その人からは、先生もＯ氏も見えない。 そうして置いて、先生は、こちらの部屋から浄霊を始めた。珍らしいものを見るように、Ｏ氏は、先生の手つきを見つめていた。 ところが、不思議なことに気がついた。 先生が掌をかざすと、見えない隣の部屋の人が、咳をはじめる。 先生が掌を下すと、その人の咳もやむ。 こういうことが二三度続いた。 （どうだ。わかったか） 先生は、そういう顔をする。 Ｏ氏は、ちょっと呑まれた形で、つぶやく。 （これは、いける！） 先生には、自信があった。殆ど誰にも批判は許さぬといわんばかりの烈々たる自信を持っていた。教義で来いという自信満々の気魄をみなぎらせていた。そして、事実、私生活などでも、大先生以外の者が、私生活についてとやかく言うと、非常に機嫌が悪かった。時には、まともに怒り出した。 （どうだ。わかったか） この顔が生涯を通じての先生の顔であったとは言わない。しかし、大先生にめぐり合ってからの先生の顔は、常に、不退転の勇猛心を現わすこの顔であった。 あとになって、Ｏ氏は、こう言っている。 「とにかく、先生は、霊力の鋭い人と思います。霊感の強い人と言ってもいいでしょう。宗教人としては、申し分のない人です。しかし、宗教行政の面では、全く駄目な人でした。言い換えれば、教祖的資質の人であって、教団組織者ではないのです。純粋、一本槍、厳格――しかし、その厳格さは、他人に対すると同様に自己に対してもそうであった。そう思いますね。私が先生に会ったのは、僅か二度しかありませんが」 四十七 昭和二十四年九月、天国会の会報「天国之友」が創刊された。 従来、各分会で謄写版あるいは活版の分会報が出ていたが、「これでは、天国会全体の動きを知ることは出来ないから」という先生の意見で、約五十頁の活版誌が出ることになったのであるが、その創刊号に載せられた「発刊に際して」という一文は、いろいろの示唆を含んでいる。 「会長先生の御意向としては、各分会長は、天国会の地域的世話人代表として、天国建設の御用をすべきであって、分会と分会との間に垣根が出来ては、会の目的と相反することになります。善言讃詞の中にもありますように、国と国との境なく、人草達の憎しみや争いごとも夢と消えて行かなくてはなりません。 天国会は、どこまでも一つであり、幾ら分会がふえても一つの会であり、ただ、会の運営上、大体地域的に分会をふやすのであって、各分会長は、総本部の直属の教師であり、各地に出張の形をとっていることをお忘れなきよう御願いいたします。 要するに、分会がふえることは、天国会が大きくなることで、一本の木に例えれば、如何に枝葉が沢山になっても、みな幹から分岐しているのと同様の理であります。幹が枯れれば、枝や葉も枯れてしまうのであります」 この「天国之友」は、次いで十月号を出したが、十一月は休み、十二月に増頁の第三号を出して、それで廃刊となった。 その理由の一つとして、大先生が、「日本観音教団として、昭和二十三年の十二月から地上天国という月刊誌を発行しているのだから、屋上屋を重ねるようなことはしない方がいい」という注意を与えたと言われる。 しかし、先生が、意識的に、屋上屋を重ねるために「天国之友」を発刊したのではないことは確かである。 これは、単に会報だけの問題ではない。先生は、あくまでも自分は大先生の下僕であるという慎みを忘れなかった。当時の日本観音教団教義にもある通り、「岡田自観先生は、観世音菩薩が人類救済のための代行者として選ばれたる力徳者たることを信じ」て、自分の生涯を、その前に投げ出していた。その大先生の言うことには、なんの口答えもすることはなかった。理屈がどうであろうと、「承知いたしました」とすぐ答えた。 この「発刊に際して」の終りにも、このことを強調することを忘れなかった。 「木の一番元は、目に見えない根であることを忘れては忘れてはなりません。大先生が、ちょうど根になられるのでありまして、幹が会長先生（創刊の辞であるから、無記名である）で、枝が各分会長で、葉が信者であります。その気が成長し、繁栄して、始めて地上天国がが出来るのであります。その木を育くむ栄養素の一部として、ここに会報が創刊されたのであります」 これは、先生だけの信念ではない。各分会長も、みなこれと同じ信念をもっていた。 その頃、分会長のＭさんは、自分が編集発行している分会ニュースの中で、次のように書いている。 「私どもは、大先生の御許に参じ、中島先生の御導きによって、観音力を戴くことが出来ました。そして、本当の宗教がもつ本当の力を知らせていただき、本当の宗教を味あわせていただきました。炎暑の中で滾々と湧き出る神力の泉に、身も魂も澄み浄められ、涼味常に身中を流るる思いに、日々を幸福に過させていただいております。なんたる幸福者でありましょう。それは、ちょうど、人々よりも一足先に苦の沙漠を過ぎて、オアシスへと中島先生に導かれ、大先生からの醍醐味を頂戴したとも言えましょう」 先生は要するに、自己に対しても相手に対しても厳格な教育者であった。 その点、一般の信者と同様に、分会を主宰する分会長といえども、手ごころは加えなかった。容赦なく、びしびしとやった。 「天国之友」を発刊する数カ月前、先生は、あるところで、こう言った。 「……また、信者の方々にお願いする。信仰は、何処までも、人を見ないで、神を中心として貰いたい。大先生の直接の教えである信仰雑話、御讃歌などに照らして分会長その他の先生を見る時、欠点だらけで、到底、宗教家として尊敬に値しないかも知れません。宗教家としては、（宗教家的活動を始めて、まだ満二年に達していないのだから）今のところは独り歩きも出来ない赤ん坊かも知れません。どうか、暫くの時日を藉していただきたい。そして彼等が立派な先生となるよう、御好意ある忠言をいただきたい。また、分会長その他の先生の言動について、不審の点がありましたら、遠慮なく私にも相談して下さい。私心を去って、お互いに手を握り、道の発展のために協力して行きましょう」 「天国之友」は、惜しくも三号で終ったが、言うならば、先生がこれを出そうと決意した心は、分会長のあいだの「和」を以て道の発展の先決条件と考えた心に外ならない。 四十八 その胸の中に、矛盾を孕んでいない人はない。矛盾こそ人間だと言っていいかも知れない。とするならば、大きな人物ほど、その胸の中の矛盾も大きいであろう。 先生も、幾多の矛盾をもっていた。直情怪行、言いたいことを言い、堅物の常として、おかしくなければ義理にも笑ってやらぬぞというようなところのあった先生だから、そとず〔づ〕らがいいとは言えない。 しかし、内面は、もっと手剛く直情的であった。次男の三六ちゃんを亡くしてからは、大分気持も弱くなったが、それでも家庭では、文字通り「厳父」であった。殊に、夫人にはきびしかった。 信者を集めての講話には、「産後の注意すべきこと。一つ、一週間は柔かい食事をとること。二つ、三週間は寝たり起きたりの程度で、過激な運動は避けること。三つ、七十五日間は新聞を読んだり、縫いもの等を控えること」などを親切に教えた先生も、夫人には、一週間も寝させては置かなかった。 これは、反面、夫人も勝気で、のうのうと寝てはいられない性分であり、寝ていては生活して行けなかった経済的な理由もあったかも知れないが、とにかく、先生は家ではきびしかった。 強い人間であったが、又弱い人であった。気が小さいところもあった。 殊に、暴力団には、弱かった。晩年、教団が大きくなり、それにつれて暴力団が、事務所に現われることも多かった。 そういう時、先生は、Ｋさんによろしく頼んで、自分は隠れていた。ある時などは、そのＫさんが、階下で暴力団と応待していると、先生は二階から、階下へ向かって、しきりに浄霊をしていた。 落ちついているように見えて、あわてん坊のところもあった。お茶の作法は、覚えたいとも思わなかったらしいが、それにしてもカラキシ駄目であった。人には、落ちつけと言っていたが、先生の心の中には、どうも落ちつけないものが何かあった。 先生は、神経質な人間が嫌いであった。けれども、先生自身も、多分に神経質なところがあった。 「気を利かせよ。気を利かせよ。気をくばれよ」と先生は、いつも言っていた。しかし、先生でも、気が利かせられないことをした。例えば、戦後、法務府の人が、教団のことを調べるために、熱海へ来た。 その人は、まず、天国会本部へ飛び込んだ。 夕方になって、食事が出た。 その人は、役目の性質上、何も食べないでただ林檎をつまみ、紅茶を飲んだだけでやめた。 その後、その人は、やはり同じ仕事の続きとして、教団の書類を検閲していた。 ところが、自分の名前が出て来て、「饗応費何円」と記してある。 一般に、こういう場合ははっきりと書かないものである。それなのに、ここにちゃんと金額まで明記してある。その人は、ちょっと首をひねった。 そのずっとあとになって、その人は、こう言っている。 「たしか、責任者は、先生だった。饗応費いくらと書いて置くなんて、あれは、先生が鷹揚だったからなのか、それとも信念なのか、性格から来ていることなのか、未だに私にはわからない」 先生は、人の欠点を見つけると、容赦なく、そこを目がけて鞭を振り下した。しかし、先生自身、欠点の多い人であった。 ただ、先生のえらかったことは、自分で自分の欠点を十分に知っていたということ、常に反省したということである。常人にはできない。 昭和十八年の終わり頃、教勢が下火になって来たことがあった。 その時も、先生は、 「私に、何か間違っているところがあるのだろう」と若い助手たちに言った。その反省は、側で見ていても、痛々しいくらいであった。 そういう先生であったから、物事の限界ということを知っていた。柄にないことはするなと、自分にも言い、人にも言っていた。 ある人が、先生に、 「私の友人が、二号の問題で、奥さんとごたごたを起していますが、どういうふうに解決したらいいでしょうか」と訊いた。 先生は、真面目な顔をして、 「君。君は、二号をもったことがあるか」 「いや。ありません」とその人は答えた。 すると、先生は、きっぱりと言った。 「経験のないことは、わからないのだから、余計なことはしないほうがいい」 だから、先生は、政治的なことは、自分はよくわからないと誰にも言い。そういう話は、全部適当な人に委せていた。そういう話となると、すぐ、その人のところに駆けつけた。 先生は、大きな人間であった。だから、大きな矛盾も持っていた。先生は、その矛盾をよく心得ていた。そこが、えらかった。 だから、先生が、亡くなったと聞き、弟子たちは、みんな泣いた。棺の前で泣き崩れた一弟子は、 「生れて初めてです。あんなに大きな声で泣いたのは。いいえ、声を出さないようにしたいと思っても、どうにもとまらなっかったのです」と言っていた。 「えらいこっちゃ。先生が亡くなられた」 そう言って、涙をポロポロこぼしながら、部屋の隅で、ひとりごとを言っている弟子もあった。 矛盾はあっても、その矛盾を包んで、先生は、大きく、強く、立派であった。 四十九 昭和二十五年、二月四日、これまでの日本観音教団と日本五六七教会を解消して、宗教法人世界救世教の一体化が実現した。 そして、教祖の称号の「大先生」は、この時から「明主」と改められた。 しかし、これより数日早く、一月三十一日の、多分午前一時頃に、先生は急逝された。 その前日、一月三十日。 先生は、鎌倉の女弟子の家へ出かけた。長男の誠八郎さんは、この分教会から、東京の大学に通っていた。 どういうつもりか、その日の朝、先生は、子供たちに、 「鎌倉のＫさんのところへ行って、みんなで晩のご飯を食べよう」と言った。 早速、仕度をして、夫人ともども家を出た。列車の中でも、春代ちゃん、光子ちゃん、和子ちゃんたちは、はしゃいでいた。 賑やかな一日が暮れた。 晩のご馳走は、スキ焼きであった。 しかし、先生はあまり食べなかった。 食後、気分が悪いと言って、先生は寝ころんで、ラジオを聞いていた。 その時、先生は、誠八郎さんに、何気ないような顔で、 「おれは、おまえに出世してくれとは言わない。人から慕われる者になって欲しいと思うよ」と言った。 先生は、これを、遺言のつもりで言ったのではないかも知れない。しかし、事実、それは誠八郎さんばかりでなく、多くの子女への遺言となった。 「私も、それを遺言と思っています」と誠八郎さんは、その日を偲んで、しみじみと言う。 まもなく、先生の気分の悪いのも治った。すくなくとも治ってしまったように見えた。 一行は、その家に下宿している長男だけを置いて、熱海へ帰って来た。家へ入った時は、もう十時になっていた。 時刻もおそかったし、寒さが沁みるような夜であったが、先生は、幹部のＡさんなどを呼んで、いろいろの話をした。好きな蜜柑も随分食べた。 そして、十二時頃、 「おれは、もう寝る」と言って、床に入った。 しばらくたって、夫人は何か胸騒ぎがするので、枕もとのスタンドをつけた。 先生は、寝ながら、自分の手で自分の頬をなでている。 （どうもおかしい） 夫人は、 「あなた」と呼びかけた。 しかし、返事はなかった。 見ると、顔色が普通ではない。 揺すっても、なんの反応もない。 夫人は、いそいでベルを押した。 Ａさんが、飛んで来た。しかし、もう目はあかなかった。口もきかなかった。 大先生も、駆けつけた。 けれども、その時は既に、心臓も停まってしまっていた。 あまりに急なことで、誰も時計を見なかった。気がついて、時計を見た時は、長針と短針はもう二時近くを示していた。 五十 父急逝の知らせを聞いて、誠八郎さんは、蒲団の上にぱっと起き上り、 「馬鹿！」と、大きな声で怒鳴った。 その声は、まだ明けやらぬ部屋の壁に、不気味にぶつかった。 昨夜、機嫌よく帰って行った父が、それから僅か数時間後には、もうこの世の人ではなくなっている。そんなことがあっていいだろうか。 文字通り、寝耳に水であった。 「馬鹿！」 それは、もちろん、父に対して言ったものではなかった。と同時に、自分に対して言ったものでもなかった。その他の誰に対して言ったものでもない。 ただ、何かに向かって、そう怒鳴らずにはいられなかった。 悲しいというような感じではなかった。くやしいという感じでもなかった。言うならば、憤懣であった。 しかし、それを何にぶつけていいのかわからなかった。 熱海の駅に降りると、熱海の町には、細かい雨がふっていた。 わが家へ入った。 しかし、なんという変化であろう。誰も、信じられないと言った表情をしていた。次から次へと駆けつけて来た人々も、みんな、突然のおどろきのためによう口もきけないという有様であった。 先生の遺体の前で、夫人は、目を赤くしていた。 昨夜――と言っても、もう十二時過ぎ、寝床に入って煙草に火をつけると、先生は、夫人に言った。 「おまえにも随分苦労をかけたが、もうこれからはよくなるぞ」 夫人は、その言葉を思い出し、幾度も胸の中で噛みしめていた。 と、急に涙があふれて来た。夫人は、それを押さえるようにして、弔問客に頭を下げた。 （あの人は、多分今夜、自分が死ぬだろうということを知っていたのだ） 涙の目で、立ち昇る線香の煙も、霞んで見えた。 隣の部屋に、声を出して泣き崩れている弟子の一人の姿が見えた。 葬儀は、四日の立春祭をすませたあと、二月五日に、熱海で執り行われた。 冷たい霙（みぞれ）が降っていた。 そして、東京中野の松源寺に葬った。 この寺は、その門前に石の猿が据えてあるので、俗に猿寺と呼ばれている。 こうして、東京の各新聞が、「日本観音教団岡田茂吉の高弟没す」と報道したその先生は、五十一才で地上を離れ、それから五年後、昭和三十年二月十日、七十三才で昇天された教祖――大先生の露払いとして、天国に赴いたのであった。 おわりに 昭和二十四年十一月、湯川秀樹博士は、ノーベル物理学賞を受けた。 中島先生は、直ちに筆を採って、書いた。 「湯川博士の湯川粒子発見は、日本はもちろん、全世界の賞賛の的となっている。しかしながら、われらはこの発見に対し、反対に恐怖心を増すものである。なんとなれば、今思い出してもぞっとするあの広島や長崎を一瞬にして潰滅させた原子爆弾の大悲劇は、われらの未だ記憶に新たなるところである。又、最近のワシントン特電によれば、米国科学専門家達の原爆に対する研究は、いよいよ進歩し、広島長崎の原爆の数千倍の破壊力を持っているとのことで、これを聞くにつれ、いよいよ恐怖は募る一方である。又、地球の一角において、これを高度から爆発させたとすると、地球上の生物は全部潰滅せしめ得るそうである。われらは、ここに新しく中性〔間〕子の発見を聞いて、喜ぶべきか、悲しむべきか、静かに考えなくてはならない。ただ、われらが喜ぶべき点は、現代科学が、目に見えざる世界へ、即ち霊的方面に一歩一歩前進しつつある事実を証明して呉れていることである」 その頃の先生の関心は、「世界」にあった。第二次大戦は終ったが、それに続く二大強国間の「冷たい戦争」は、日とともに激しくなって行く。 そして、もし、それが何処かで発火し、第三次大戦にまで延焼したら、原爆が使用されたら――そう考えると、先生は、居ても立っても居られない気持になるのであった。 「誰しも苦悩のない人はいない。人が信仰するのは、この苦悩から逃れ――換言すれば、不幸から幸福な者になりたいためである」 先生は、そう言った。 しかし、それだけでは済まされない。 湯川博士の受賞が発表される二カ月前に、先生は、こう言った。 「いくら自分の家庭、郷土、日本が救われても、原子爆弾による世界戦争が起ったとしたら、個人の幸福も、日本の幸福もあったものではない。今後は、世界人類を目標として、ものを考え、処理して行くべきである。信仰も又、世界人の幸福を祈り、自分の幸福を祈るものでなくてはならない。個人を離れて世界もなく、世界を離れて個人もあり得ないからである」 思えば、先生は、日清戦争と日露戦争のあいだの「谷間の平和」とも言うべき明治三十二年に生れた。 その翌年、朝鮮に義和団の乱があり、日本は出兵した。 十五才の時、明治は大正と改元されたが、僅か二年後には、第一次大戦が勃発した。遂には、日本もこれに参加、東洋で戦った。 続いて、昭和六年満州事変が起り、七年に五・一五事件、十一年に二・二六事件と、国内は騒然たるものがあったが、翌十二年には遂に日華事変が勃発した。 そして、十四年には第二次大戦の幕が切って落され、十六年十二月八日、日本は列強を向うに廻して、太平洋戦争の火蓋を切ったが、苦闘四年の後、二十年八月十五日、無条件降伏をした。――惨憺たる戦後。 そうして、先生は、「冷たい戦争」の結果として起った朝鮮動乱の数カ月前、昭和二十五年一月の終りに没した。 先生の五十年の生涯は、はっきりと三つの時代に分けることが出来る。 一つは、海外雄飛の夢を抱いていたが、ついに実現しないで終った青少年時代。 一つは、生活のためにサラリーマンとなったが、われら如何に生くべきかの問題に悩んだ暗中模索時代。 一つは、岡田茂吉なる人物に会い、神を発見して、ひたすらに宗教家としての活動を続けた時代。 そして、その最後において、先生は、宗教も、学問も、芸術も、すべて世界人類の福祉に貢献するものでなければならないこと、世界人類が全部、その手と手を結び、地球をめぐって「恒久平和」の輪舞をする日が、必ず到来することを信じて目を閉じた――と言っては当らないであろうか。 昭和二十六年十月三日の栄光に載せられた大先生（この時は、明主と改称されていた）の「世界人たれ」を、ここに謹んで転載させていただく。日本観音教時代既に世界宗教を期していた中島一斉先生を偲びながら―― 「これからの人間は、世界人にならなければ駄目だ。これについて面白い話がある。 終戦直後、ある軍人上りの人が私のところへ来て、憤懣（ふんまん）に堪えない面持（おももち）で“今度の降伏はどう考えても分らない”と言って、憤慨しながら話かけるのだが、私の方はサッパリ気が乗らないので、彼は呆れたらしく“先生は日本人ですか”ときくから、即座に私は“日本人じゃない”と答えると、彼はギョッとして、震えながら“ではどこの国の人間ですか”ときき返すので、私は言ってやった。“つまり世界人なんですよ”その言葉に、彼はポカンと気の抜けたような顔をして、その意味の納得のゆくまで説明してくれろと言うので、私も色々話してやったが、今それを土台にしてかいてみよう。 元来日本人とか、支那人とか言って、差別をつけるのが第一間違っている。あの頃の日本人がそれで、日清、日露の二回の戦役に勝ち、急に一等国の仲間入りをしたのでのぼせ上り、日本は神国なりなどと、何か特別の国のように思ったり、思わせたりして、ついにあのような戦争まで引き起したのである。 そんな訳だから、他国民を犬猫のように侮蔑し、その国の人間を殺すなど何とも思わず、思いのままに他国を荒し廻ったので、ついに今日のような敗戦の憂き目を見る事になったのである。そのように自分の国さえよけりゃ、人の国などどうなってもいいというような思想がある限り、到底世界の平和は望めないのである。 これを日本の国だけとしてたとえてみても分る。ちょうど県と県との争いのようなものとしたら、日本内の事であるから、言わば兄弟同士の食（は）み合いで、簡単に型〔片〕がつくに決っている。この道理を世界的に押し拡げればいいのである。 かの明治大帝の御製にある有名な“四方（よも）の海みな同胞（はらから）と思ふ世に、など波風の立ち騒ぐらむ”すなわちこれである。みんなこの考えになれば、明日からでも世界平和は成立つのである。全人類が右のような広い気持になったとしたら、世界中どの国も内輪同士という訳で、戦争など起りよう訳がないではないか。 この理によって今日でも何々主義、何々思想などといって、その仲間のグループを作り、他を仇（かたき）のように思ったり、ヤレ国是だとか、何国魂とか、何々国家主義だとか、神国などと言って、一人よがりの思想が、その国を過（あやま）らせるのみか、世界平和の妨害ともなるのである。 だからこの際少なくとも日本人全体は、今度の講和を記念として、世界人となり、今までの小乗的考えを揚棄（ようき）し、大乗的考えになる事である。これが今後の世界における、最も進歩的思想であって、世界はこの種の人間を必要とするのである」 ――――――――――・―――――――・――――――――――

本書に引用の御論文「世界人たれ」は少し手が加えられています。ほとんど問題とするに当らないところですが、最後の一文が省略されていますので、ここに掲載します。 「話は違うが宗教などもそれと同じで、何々教だとか、何々宗、何々派などといって、派閥など作るのは、最早時代遅れである。ところが自慢じゃないが本教である。本教が他の宗教に対して、触るるな〔な〕どというケチな考えはいささかもない。反って触るるのを喜ぶくらいである。というのは本教は全人類を融和させ、世界を一家のごとくする平和主義であるからで、この意味において、本教ではいかなる宗教でも、仲間同志と心得、お互いに手を携え、仲良く進もうとするのである。」

―― 岡田自観師の論文集 ―― 御教え検索 ： help 資料検索 ： 伝道の手引き Ⅱ －１－２ 御神体について 五、 月 次 祭 １ 月次祭の意義 〔 御垂示（S26年9月8日） 『御垂示録』2号、昭和26(1951)年10月10日発行〕 「月並祭に参拝する場合は、光をたくさんいただき、魂を浄めていただくでしょうか」 『神様がそうなんです。それと同じなんです。人間が多勢上がりますね。そうすると、神様の光が強くなる。それでお蔭をいただく。神様の光は蜘蛛の巣がかかったりしていると出ないんです。』 ２ 御祭りは早くしても遅くしてはいけない事 〔 御光話（S23年 5月18日） 『御光話録』発行年月日不明、推定昭和26年頃。〕 ――毎月十八日のお観音様の日にお祀りできない場合は―― 『十七日にしたらよい。神仏のお祀りや法事なぞは早くするのはよいが遅れるのはいけない。』 ３ 月次祭は勝手に日取りを変えてはいけない事 〔 御光話（S24年 8月23日） 『御光話録』14号、昭和24(1949)年11月20日発行〕 ――私は本年一月に教修をいただきましたが、三月に光明如来様をいただき、三月三十日に分会長先生に来ていただいて例祭をいたし、また四月二十六日にも分会長先生に来ていただいて例祭をいたしましたが、その際、突然御三方の上においた割れ目のないコップが割れて、中の水がこぼれてしまいました。ところが同じ御三方の上の御屏風観音様はどうしたことか少しも濡れませんでした。コップの割れたこと、御屏風の濡れなかったことになにか意味があるように存じますがいかがでしょうか。 『例祭って言うけど、日は決めてないんですか。』 ――決めてございます。 『幾日に決めてあるんですか。』 ――三月三十日に決めていたしました。 『いや、毎月幾日に決めてあるんですか。』 ――はあ、それが…… 『いや、例祭って言うんだから、毎月何日っていうことは決めてあるんでしょ。』 ――はあ、ございます。 『だから幾日に決めてあるんですか。』 ――二十八日でございます。 『二十八日……ところがこれは違うじゃない、三十日なんて。決めた日より早いのはいいけど、遅れるのは非常に悪いんです。これは知っとかなければいけない事です。すべて神仏の事は早くなるのならいいが、遅れるのはとてもいけない。この遅れたのはどういうわけです。』 ――それは、分会長先生のご都合があったものですから…… 『分会長の都合で神様の事を遅らすんなら、分会長のほうが神様より上になってしまう、はなはだ御無礼千万ですよ。それから次のは四月二十六日で、これは早過ぎてる。本当は早過ぎるのもよくないんだけど、遅れるのよりかずっといいんです。この、早くしたのはどういうわけですか、また分会長の都合ですか。』 ――いえ、それは書き間違いと存じます。四月は二十八日にいたしました。 『これは書き間違いですか。……なにしろ、例祭をすると決めた日を絶対に守るっていう気持ちがあれば、御守護があってちゃんと都合よく行くんです。ところが、心にゆるみがあるといろんな差し支えが起ったりするんです。熱海へ来るんでもそうですよ。この次は何日に熱海に絶対にお詣りに行くと決めたら、なんの故障もなく来れるものなんです。それを、都合がよかったらとか、そのときの都合でどうとか思ってると、きっと故障が起るんです。邪神がいつも邪魔しようと狙ってるんですからね。心にゆるみができると邪神に隙を与えることになるんです。雨が降っても、槍が降ってもどんなことがあっても行くっていう心構えだったら決して邪神は邪魔できない。固く決心すれば間違いの起ることはないんです。 それから「御三方の上の屏風観音様」とあるけども、これはどういうわけで御三方なんかに入れてあるんです。』 ――はい、仏壇がないものですから、御三方にのせてお祀りいたしております。 『それは間違ってる。あれは仏壇に入れるものなんです。他の所に祀って拝むなんて間違ってますよ。ちゃんと仏壇の中へお祀りするように決めてあるんだからその通りにやんなさい。その通りにしないんなら祀らないほうがいい。神様が決めたことを人間のほうでどうするっていうのは、人間のほうが神様より上になりますよ。コップが割れたのは、こんな間違ったことをしてるのに対する神様の戒めですよ。』 ４ 二十三日が月次祭の所は御生誕祭の折どうすべきか 〔 御垂示（S27年12月1日） 『御垂示録』16号、昭和27(1952)年12月15日発行〕 「十二月二十三日は御誕生祭でございますが、二十三日に月並祭をいたしております所が多いようで、今月に限り変えさせていただきまして」 『良いです。日はいつでも良いです。』 「御誕生祭にはお参りさせていただきますほうがよろしゅうございますから」 『決まったことはしなければいけません。それで誕生祭というのは意味が違いますから―』 ５ （海外で）曜日で月次集を決める場合 〔 御垂示（S27年5月1日） 『御垂示録』9号、昭和27(1952)年5月15日発行〕 「ハワイの信者よりの質問でございますが、月並祭をさせていただきますのに、向うは月の日より曜日で決めるそうでございますが、お許しをいただけますもので――」 『良いですよ。』 「土曜日でもよろしゅうございましょうか」 『結構ですよ。土曜日が一番良いでしょう。』 「金曜日はそういうことには使いませんようでございますが」 『キリストの受難日だからね。十三日の金曜日だからね。』 「週が四つありますが、第一土曜日というように決めなくても――」 『決めなくても良いが、第一の方が良いです。何でも早い方が良いです。早い方が基本になりますからね。それで私は、この集りを一日にした。それから数からいうと、割り切れる数――偶数ですね。これが陽になる。だから奇数偶数の事柄によって合せるということも良いんですね。』 六、祭祀の方式 一、 御神体奉斎並びにお取次 １ 御神体御奉斎の日取について 〔 教えの光（地上天国22号) 昭和26(1951)年3月25日発行〕 「御神体御奉斎日は、二、四、六、九の日は避くべきでございましょうか。謹んでお伺い申し上げます。」 『そう決まったこともないが、なるべくよい日がいい。いい日とは一、五、八の数がいい。その意味は、一ははじめであり元であり、主の神であり、五は出ずるであり、火であり陽であり、最高の数である。八は五、三で、伊都能売（いづのめ）であり、火、水であり、発する、開く、拡がる、富士山の形、無限の数などで、また十一は、統一であり、経緯（たてよこ）結んで始まるという意味で、十五は結んで出ずる。十八は、結んで開く、五六七、三六九の合計であり、また気であり、非常によい。二十一は、二つが結んで始まる意味で、結婚日にもよい。二十五は、五、五、二十五で、日が出ずるという意味で、非常に陽な意味である。二十八は、二つが結んで開くのだから、いいに決まっている。観音様がインドで、観自在菩薩と申されたとき、二十八部衆といって、二十八人の御家来があったことや、法華経は二十八品となっている。その二十五番が観音普門品（かんのんふもんぼん）であり、観音様は日の仏様だから陽である。 ここで、ちょっと神秘なことを書いてみるが、だいたい仏教の教えは七である。というのはお釈迦様は土のミロクであるから、土すなわち七である。七の倍が十四で、その倍が二十八であるから、三すなわち水であり月であるとしたら、月と土の教えで、印度とは印が月で度が土であるという意味である。陰土であり、昔インドは月氏国といったのだから、仏教の意味もこれで判ったであろう。』 ２ 一軒の家で御神体を二体祀るは不可なる事 〔 御光話（S24年11・12月） 『御光話録』16号、昭和25(1950)年1月20日発行〕 ――床の間が二つございます家で、大光明如来様と光明如来様の御姿とそれぞれお祀りさせていただいてよろしいでしょうか。 『これはそんな必要ありませんよ。いいほうの床の間へどちらでもいいからお祀りすればいいんです。両方お祀りするってのはやはり嘘ですよ。』 ３ 一軒の家で御神体を二体祀るは不可なる事 〔 御垂示（S26年4月1日） 『御垂示録』6号、昭和27(1952)年1月25日発行〕 「光明如来様、大光明如来様をいただいておりますが、部屋が一つしかないのでお掛けすることができませんのでございますが――」 『御神体は一軒の中に二ヵ所はいけない。一ヵ所でなければならない。』 ４ 御神体（御姿も）はやたらに動かしてはいけない事 〔 御光話（S24年11・12月） 『御光話録』16号、昭和25(1950)年1月20日発行〕 ――教修会のとき、教導所がせまいため旅館などを借ります場合、一時、大光明如来様を旅館の床の間にお祀りして教修会を開いておりますが、これはよろしゅうございましょうか。 『これはいけませんね。間違ってますよ、これは。……そうですね、もし御軸をなにするんだったら、光明如来様じゃなくて、「光明」とか「真善美」とかいうのをかけたらいいでしょう。』 ５ 屋根の修理の為に（御神体の）上に上る事の可否 〔 御光話（S25年 4月13日） 『御光話録』19号、昭和25(1950)年6月13日発行〕 ――雪国では屋根の雪を降ろす場合とか草屋根修理の場合などにしばしば屋根に登りますが、光明如来様をお祀り申し上げてある家ではいったんおはずしいたすべきでしょうか。 『こんなのはかまいませんよ。屋根を修理するためなんだから御無礼にはなりませんよ。雨漏りなんかでも神様はお許しになりますよ。……あのね、神様ってお方はよく判っておられますからね、だから物事によって適当にすればいいんですよ。』 ６ 屋根の修理の為に御神体をお外しした人へ 〔 御垂示（S28年8月1日） 『御垂示録』23号、昭和28(1953)年8月15日発行〕 「御神前のフスマを閉めようとして、無理に閉めたところ、大きな物音がし、明主様の御写真が床の上に落ち、ガラスが割れ、お袴の裾に針の先で突いたほどの傷と、かすったほどの傷が二、三カ所つき、御神体の表装の下のほうに三分くらいの切傷がガラスの破片でつき、お茶が少々かかりました。表装をしなおし本日持参いたしました。お詫び申し上げます」 『見て差し支えなければ浄めてあげます。』 「そのことにつきましてこういうことがございました。その以前に屋根の雨樋の修理のために職人が屋根に上がるので、御神体と御写真をお外ししたそうでございます」 『それが悪いのです。そのとき外したのがいけません。』 「屋根に人が乗りますので」 『乗るときは神様にお詫びすればよいのです。移動したのがいけません。』 「もったいないと思いましたので」 『そうではないのです。それは修繕するのだから、やむを得ないのです。神様は許されます。屋根に上がらねば修理できないので、樋が直らなければ被害をこうむりますから、神様としてもおとがめはありません。神様は理屈が立てば決しておとがめはありません。それを外したということは、神様を侮辱したわけです。神様はずいぶん気がきかないというように見られたわけです。ですから神様は気に入らないのです。』 ７ 御神体が長すぎる場合 （その一） 〔 御光話（S25年 3月 3日） 『御光話録』19号、昭和25(1950)年6月13日発行〕 ――床の間の天井が低い場合、御神体の上のほうをお巻きしてもよろしいでしょうか。 『いけませんね、これは。切ればいいでしょう、長ければ。下のほうが引きずってるのはいけませんよ。人間だって着物が引きずってたんじゃ気持ちが悪いでしょ。（笑声）』 御神体が長すぎる場合 （その二） 〔 御垂示（S26年4月1日） 『御垂示録』6号、昭和27(1952)年1月25日発行〕 「中二階ですが、上が低いので、お軸の下をまくのと、ひきずるのとは、どちらにいたしましたらよろしいでしょうか」 『絶対にいけない。どっちもいけない。長ければ軸を切れば良い。人間でも、足からひきずっていたらおかしい。』 ８ 御神体が風でゆれる事について （その一） 〔 御垂示（S26年8月1日） 『御垂示録』1号、昭和26(1951)年9月15日発行〕 「御神体ですが、田舎では風の当たりの強いところがありますので、押さえますのに 風鎮がよろしうございましょうか。糸で――」 『それが良いです。両方に釘を打って、糸を張る。あれが一番良い。風鎮は駄目です。風が強いと風鎮では駄目です。』 御神体が風でゆれる事について （その二） 〔 御垂示（S29年4月1日） 『御垂示録』30号、昭和29(1954)年4月15日発行〕 「夏になりますと戸を開けますが、風が強い場合には御神体が動きますので、下を白い糸でつけてよろしいでしょうか」 『よいです。その場合は糸を横に張ったほうが確かです。』 ９ 御神体奉斎の方角 〔 教えの光（地上天国21号) 、昭和26(1951)年2月25日発行〕 「光明如来様を奉斎させていただきましたが、家は床の間がなく、二世帯同居のため狭いのですが、障子の所へ板を張り、仮床を造って祭らせていただこうと思いますが、どの方角に向けてお祭りしたらよろしいでしょうか。お伺いいたします。」 『方角は東西南北いずれでもよろしいが、位置はその部屋の一番上座に当たる所がよろしい。』 二、御神前の間について １ 田舎で薪をたく為、御神体の煤ける時はどうすれば 〔 御垂示（S26年8月1日） 『御垂示録』1号、昭和26(1951)年9月15日発行〕 「田舎で薪をたくために煤けて黒くなり困っておりますので、ひどく汚れるときだけ、なにかおかけしてもよろしうございましょうか」 『白羽二重（はぶたえ）でも良いから、まいておいて、そういうときだけ、さもなければ両方に釘を打って、釘も本当は竹釘が良いです。そうして、羽二重の縁を縫って輪を作って、ふだんまいておき、そういうときだけかける。それが良いでしょう。』 ２ 屋根裏利用の部屋について 〔 御光話（S24年4月特輯号） 『御光話録』6号、昭和24(1949)年4月23日発行〕 ――屋根裏利用の部屋の場合、その屋根裏は天井が低く、床の間を作ることができませんが、いかがいたすべきでしょうか。 『この屋根裏になにもない場合は、その下の床の間に御神体をお祀りしても差し支えありませんが、たいてい物置きくらいには使いますからね。物置きに使っている場合には下の床の間にはお祀りしないほうがいいんです。無論、屋根裏にはお祀りできないですよ。そこは物置きですからね。すべて床の間でも物を置いてはいけない。ただ花いけ、香炉などは飾りだからいいですがね、物を置くと物置きになるからいけない。だからまあ、下に御神体でない文字をかけるんですね、そしてね、その人の信仰しだいでちゃんと屋根裏のない家に住むことができるようになります。』 ３ 二階が物置になっている場合（農家）その一 〔 御垂示（S28年5月1日） 『御垂示録』20号、昭和28(1953)年5月15日発行〕 「地方の農家では、二階はございますが、農機具、藁、ムシロなどを置いております所が多いので、御神体様をいただくのに苦しんでおりますので、床の間だけを二階のないほうの外に廂（ひさし）のような物を出しますのでございますが、その場合でもすぐに二階は見えるわけでございます。こういうことはお許しいただけますでしょうか」 『その場合に、廂をどのくらい出すか、その寸法によっては、ごく良くもないがしかたがないです。少なくとも三尺くらい出して床の間にするのならよいです。その間の三尺は畳を一畳敷くとかして、その先に床の間を作るのならよいです。』 二階が物置になっている場合（土蔵）その二 〔 御光話（S24年 5月 3日） 『御光話録』10号、昭和24(1949)年7月10日発行〕 ――ただいまお寺の一室を借り教導所といたしておりますが、このたびそこを出ねばなりませんので親類の家の土蔵を借りて御浄霊いたしたいと存じますが、その土蔵の二階は現在物置きで天井はありません。階下には床の間がありますが、そこに大光明如来様をお祀りしてもよろしいでしょうか。 『絶対いけませんよ。人間のいる所より以下になりますからたいへんな御無礼ですよ。こういう所はお祀りしないほうがいいんです。だからここに御神体をおかけするんなら、物置きではどうも具合が悪いから……』 ――農家などではそんな家が多うございますが、階下が張り出している場合はよろしいでしょうか。 『張り出てても、二階のすぐ近くじゃいけません。そうとう離れてればいいですが…… この人は物置きに床の間を作り、天井をつけて直せばいい。それだけの金がなければ一生懸命にお願いして、一心にやってれば金がちゃんと入りますよ。』 ４ 二階に物を入れねば階下に祀ってよき事 〔 御垂示（S28年6月1日） 『御垂示録』21号、昭和28(1953)年6月15日発行〕 「先月御垂示いただきました二階のある農家での御神体の御奉斎につきまして、二階を絶対に使わない場合はいかがでございましょうか」 『それなら構いません。何にもなければよいです。物を置けば神様が物以下ということになり、また人間がそこにはいっていると、人間が神様を踏むことになるから、それがいけないのです。そういった点がなければ差し支えありません。それなら屋根と同じことになりますからよいです。』 ５ （見晴しのよい二階の）蚕室を改造して御神体をお祀りして良いか 〔 御垂示（S26年10月8日） 『御垂示録』3号、昭和26(1951)年11月25日発行〕 「田舎の家で、二階に御神体をお祀りさせていただくために、蚕室（さんしつ）になっておりますが、見晴らしが良いので、そこを改造いたしたいと思いますが、いかかでございましょうか」 『結構です。』 「床の間の具合は、どういう風にいたしたらよろしいでしょうか」 『座敷の形でしかるべくすると良い。』 「南向きでございますが」 『南向きは構いません。ただ、座敷で一番位置が良い所ですね。一番良いというのは、入口から一番離れたところですね。それから、後戻りしないことですね。座敷に入って、突き当たりか、横なら良いです。』 ６ 天井の低い場合、床の間だけ屋根を高くしてお祀りしても良いか 〔 御垂示（S29年2月1日） 『御垂示録』28号、昭和29(1954)年2月15日発行〕 「昨年一月入信の信者でございますが、御神体御奉斎の希望ですが、二階が非常に低く、端のほうで三尺ぐらいしかありませんので、屋根を床の間の幅だけ三尺ぐらい上げて作りますのはいかがでしょうか」 『それならよいです。』 ７ 御神前の間に額等をかけては不可なる事 〔 御垂示（S26年12月1日） 『御垂示録』5号、昭和26(1951)年12月25日発行〕 「支那の大同の石の観音さんを写真にして持っておりますが――」 『石仏にもたくさんありますがね。良い悪いがいろいろあります。それは、額にしても、何にしても良いが、神様の部屋はいけませんよ。』 ８ 御神前の間に明主様の写ってない写真はかけては不可な事 〔 教えの光（地上天国21号) 、昭和26(1951)年2月25日発行〕 「先日御神殿を掃除する際、大黒様の槌の柄が折れました。この大黒様は、数十年前からあったものですが、剣を持っておられたのを私が、槌を作って取りつけたのです。また、これと前後して、同じ室内に掲げてある渋井総斎先生の写られた御写真（昨年五六七大祭のときのもの）の中味だけが二十度くらい傾きました。なにかのお知らせでございましょうか。」 （中略） 『また写真については、私の写っていない写真は、絶対掲げてはいけないことになっているから、これも祖霊の戒告である。』 附 御額の掲げた部屋に故人の写真を掲げぬ事 〔 御光話（S23年 5月28日） 『御光話録』発行年月日不明、推定昭和26年頃。〕 『故人の写真をかけるのは仏間ならどこでもよい。私の額がかかっているところは駄目です。ただやむを得ないなら、できるだけ額から離してかけてもよい。 古い以前の御屏風には寺の名が入っているが、あれは当局がうるさいからやったまでです。新しいのをお祀りしたければしてもよい。そして古いのは人にやったらいいでしょう。』 三、御神床について １ 置き床でお祀りしてもよい事 〔 御光話（S25年 4月 3日） 『御光話録』19号、昭和25(1950)年6月13日発行〕 ――床の間のない家で御神体を御奉斎いたします場合、置き床でもよろしいでしょうか。 『いいでしょう。それよりか、ほかにしようがないですからね。』 ２ 床の間の壁について 〔 御垂示（S28年12月1日） 『御垂示録』27号、昭和28(1953)年12月15日発行〕 「信者で床の間を作りましたが、床の間は手前の壁は塗らないのが法則だそうですが、その人はそういうのは嫌だから全部塗ってくれと言ったが塗ってくれないそうです」 『それはどっちでもよいです。そういうことは問題ではないです。わざと塗ってありませんが、その人の気持でどっちでも差し支えないです。それほど重要な問題ではないので、壁土の問題です。塗ってない所の家でも、火事で焼けるときは焼けるし、災難にも遭います。』 ３ 逆床でもそのままでよいとお許しを頂いた例 〔 御垂示（S26年11月8日） 『御垂示録』4号、昭和26(1951)年12月10日発行〕 「床の間が入口に近いところにあり、奥のほうは板の間になっており、屋根が低くなっております」 『まずいな。感心しないですね。直したら良い。』 「天井をぶち抜くので――」 『片っ方の良い天井にはできないですか。いけないけれども、直すのはたいへんでしょう。直せれば直したが良いが、直せなければ、我慢はできます。新規に建てるならできるがね。我慢すればできます。そう悪いわけでもないんですからね。一番悪いのは、子供の部屋を二階に作り、親父のは下に作る。そうすると、子供は言うことを聞かないですね。これだけは、どうしても直さなければならない。』 ４ 二階の御神前と階段の位置 〔 御垂示（S26年12月1日） 『御垂示録』5号、昭和26(1951)年12月25日発行〕 「二階の階段を改造し、奥の大光明如来様をお祀りしてある部屋につけるのでございますが、床の間が戻るようになってはいけないので――」 『戻らないほうが良いんですね。そういった――家の建て具合で、やむを得ないのはしかたがないですが、できる限りそうしないほうが良い。横なら良いです。横なら良いが、戻るのはまずいです。戻らない限り、どっちに行っても構わないがね。』 ５ 床と違い棚の位置について 〔 御垂示（S26年10月8日） 『御垂示録』3号、昭和26(1951)年11月25日発行〕 「普通は、床の間は半分違い棚、半分床の間になっておりますが、真ん中でよろしいでしょうか」 『そうです。それで良い。それから、半分にわける場合に、入口に近いほうが違い棚、遠いほうが床の間になる。奥のほうが床の間ですね。そうすれば良い。おのずからどこが上座か分かりますね。』 「私の家は反対になっておりますが――」 『そういうのはたくさんありますよ。』 「廊下に近いところが床の間で、遠いほうが違い棚になっておりますが――」 『廊下じゃないんです。入口です。入口と言っているんです。床の間のほうは廊下でも構わない。入口が出入りするでしょう。廊下と言うのはあまり出入りはしない。だから、入口から遠いほうですね。』 「家の階下の、入口の上がお祀りしてある所、と言うのは関係ありませんでしょうか」 『とにかく、二階は下と関係ないんですからね。二階だけのことで良いんです。』 ６ 御神床の裏が便所でも差支えないか（その一） 〔 御光話（S24年 4月23日） 『御光話録』7号、昭和24(1949)年**月**日発行〕 ――床の間の裏手が便所になっている家がよくありますがいかがでしょうか。 『差し支えないですよ。そんなことを言ってたらお祀りできやしない。こんな家はたくさんありますからね。便所の中はいけませんが、（笑声）壁があればいいですよ。（笑声）』 御神床の裏が便所でも差支えないか（その二） 〔 御垂示（S28年12月1日） 『御垂示録』27号、昭和28(1953)年12月15日発行〕 「床の間の裏側に便所があるのはいかがでございましょうか」 『構いません。そういう家が多いのですから、それを気にしていたらたいへんです。』 七、布教所（及び集会所） １ 布教所と自宅とそれぞれに御神体をお祀りすべきこと（その一） 〔 御垂示（S26年4月1日） 『御垂示録』6号、昭和27(1952)年1月25日発行〕 「御神体は二ヵ所はいけないということでございましたが、信者さんが来てお詣りする所と、私がおります奥のほうとございますが――」 『ああ、そういう場合には二つで良いのです。片方は教会で公ですから、良いんです。』 布教所と自宅とそれぞれに御神体をお祀りすべきこと（その二） ① 原 則 〔 御垂示（S28年8月1日） 『御垂示録』23号、昭和28(1953)年8月15日発行〕 「教会と住居が同じでございますが、住居の離れにおかけしてあった御神体を、同じ屋敷内という意味で教会のほうにおかけしましたが、それでよろしいものでございましょうか」 『光明如来様を教会とは別々にするのですか。それならよいです。』 「一つでございます」 『それは別々でなければいけません。そうでなければ公私混同です。やっぱり教会というのは宗教活動のためにある公（おおやけ）なもので、個人のほうにあるのは、個人の家庭を御守護していただくというので、それは別です。』 ② 臨機応変 〔 御垂示（S28年8月1日） 『御垂示録』23号、昭和28(1953)年8月15日発行〕 「一軒の家で離れがない場合には御神体は一体でよろしいでしょうか」 『それも臨機応変です。広い家なら別々でよいが、狭い家は一つでよいです。教会と住居を区分して決められるくらいの広さがあれば別々にしたほうがよいです。それからまた急ぐ場合とか、いろいろな場合に、あるときまでは、床の間が狭いとか、御神前が狭いとかいう場合には兼帯でしてもよいです。それから、その部屋の具合が、もう分離して別々にしても充分によいという場合には今言ったとおりにするのです。』 附 〔 御垂示（S26年7月1日） 『御垂示録』6号、昭和27(1952)年1月25日発行〕 「一軒の家で御神体は、二体様お祀りしてはいけないとの御教えをいただいておりますが、農家で、母屋に兄が住み、離れに弟が住んでおりますが、両方に御神体をお祀りいたしております。弟さんのほうは座談会に行かせていただいたりしております」 『兄さんのほうは、そこの家を守り、弟さんのほうは宗教的宣伝をすると言うのですから、別々でかまわない。かえって別々が本当です。片方は農家の家を護って――やはり祖先はいるが、倒れたりするのは嫌がりますから、家を御守護して、弟さんのほうは宣伝を主にするので、別々だから良いんです。』 「母屋は良い部屋がなく、離れに立派なのができておりますが」 『それで良い。霊界ではそこが中心になっている。』 ２ （集会所）へ御神体をお借しする事について 〔 御光話（S24年11・12月） 『御光話録』16号、昭和25(1950)年1月20日発行〕 ――教導所の出張所に私のいただいた御神体を一時お貸ししてお祀りいたすことはいかがでしょうか。 『それはかまいませんね、おかけしたっきりでそこでお祀りするんなら。それから、人に貸してあげるのも、その人が自分でいただくまで一時仮に貸すんならいいですよ。』 ３ 布教所の御神体を元の所有者に返すについて （註）前項の傍線部をよく参照のこと 〔 御垂示（S28年10月1日） 『御垂示録』25号、昭和28(1953)年10月15日発行〕 「御神体を戴いた兄が表装がまだで御奉斎できず、弟が出張所をさせていただきましたが、事情により出張所の責任者が代りました場合には御神体はそのままでよろしいのでございましょうか」 『兄さんのほうはどうしてますか。』 「家の都合で御奉斎ができません」 『それで出張所のほうにまわしたわけですか。兄さんは支部長ですか。』 「一般信者でございます」 『信仰は続けていますか。』 「続けております」 『兄さんが信仰していればよいでしょう。』 「兄が御奉斎のお許しをいただきました場合には」 『新しくしなければいけません。出張所のは動かすことはできません。』 「現在の出張所のはそのままでよろしいのでございましょうか」 『よいです。それから私の写真と御神体との扱い方は違います。どう違うかと言うと写真のほうが上だから、写真は少しも融通ということはできません。それでこの間のことはやかましく言ったのです。それはそうでしょう、御神体は私が書くのですから、書くほうが上です。』 八、礼拝・祈り等 １ 祝詞と御願事とはいずれを先にすべきか 〔 妙智之光（地上天国６号） 、昭和24(1949)年7月20日発行〕 「祝詞とお願い事とはいずれを先にすべきでしょうか。」 『祝詞のほうを先に奏げるのが本当で、お願い事は私事であるから後にすべきである。祝詞を奏げる一番の目的は霊界を浄めるにある。また祝詞を奏げると霊がたくさん来る。祝詞をきくと霊が向上するからである。また祝詞は神に対する感謝の意が中心になっている。』 ２ 神様にお願事する場合心に念えば口に出さなくても同じか 〔 御光話（S24年 1月18日） 『御光話録』3号、昭和24(1949)年2月8日発行〕 ――神様にお願い事をする場合、心に思えば口に出さなくても同じと考えさせていただいてよろしいでしょうか。 『これは違いますよ。例えば私があんたにごちそうしようと思ったって、あんたはうまくもなんともないでしょう。（笑声）やはり形に表わすことが大切です。だから言葉にも表わすべきです。まあ、思うだけでも思わぬよりはいいでしょうがね……』 ３ 大勢で礼拝する時の祈りの仕方について 〔 御光話（S24年 6月 3日） 『御光話録』12号、昭和24(1949)年9月21日発行〕 ――いままでは平伏のときにお願い事をさせていただいておりましたが、ただいまはその時間がございませんが、これは…… 『大勢のときはお願いなんかしないほうがいいですよ、時間がかかってしようがないから。ふだん必要なときにお願いすりゃあそれでいいですよ。 こっちは神道じゃないんですからね、神主的意味でごていねいにやらなくていいんです。この道は神道でもあり、仏教でもあるんですからね。拍手にしたって坊さんは拍手を打たないでしょ。だからそこんとこは臨機応変にすればいいですよ。ただ敬う形は崩さないようにね。』 ４ 人の大勢居る御神前でのお念じの仕方等 〔 御光話（S24年 1月18日） 『御光話録』3号、昭和24(1949)年2月8日発行〕 ――教導所に来てお詣りする場合、周りに人が大勢いたりしますと、声を出さぬことが多いのでございますが…… 『それは状況によって適当にすればいい。よく、クシャクシャ小声で言っている人があるでしょう。あれでいいのですよ。また、御浄霊するときは念じないほうがいい。それから危急のときは口に出して念じたほうがよろしい。が、絶体絶命の時は私に頼みなさい。そういう場合は字や絵よりも生きている私のほうが力がある。つまり、私がその仕事の実行者だから。』 ５ 個人的な祈りと信徒と共に行うお祈り 〔 御垂示（S26年11月5日） 『御垂示録』4号、昭和26(1951)年12月10日発行〕 「出張所をやらせていただく場合に、着きましたと同時に、お参りさせていただくべきでしょうか。信徒が一番集まるのは、一時か二時ですが、そのとき一緒にすべきでしょうか」 『それは、そこまでに着くと、そこの家に行くんでしょう。そうしたら、すぐやったら良い。できるだけ早いほうが良いですよ。祀詞を奏げてね。』 「信徒と一緒にするのは差し支えありませんでしょうか」 『差し支えないじゃない。結構です。それは意味が違う。着いたときは、これからの御守護とお礼で、信徒と一緒のときは、信徒の御守護とお礼です。神様のことは几帳面でなければならない。』 「帰りには――」 『帰りには、無論お礼と――そこに滞在中のお礼と、信徒の今後の御守護と、それで構いません。来たときも、信徒が集まっているなら一緒で良いが、そうでなく、行ったとき自分だけだったら、切り離すのが本当です。』 ６ 御詣りの最中眠くなるのは 〔 御光話（S24年7月特輯号） 『御光話録』9号、昭和24(1949)年7月30日発行〕 ――私は入信以来すでに五回の御面会をいただいておりますが、お祈りのとき、御讃歌のときなどに必ず眠くなります。例祭のときは特に眠気を催しますが、これはなぜでしょうか。 『これには二つの意味がありますが、一つはね、神様が嫌で眠くなるんです。副守護神が御讃歌などを聞くのがつらいんです。それからもう一つはね、そういうものを聞きたい霊がたくさんある場合、本人を眠らしたほうがその霊はよく聞けるんです。だからこのほうは悪くないですね。私も以前そんなことがありましたよ。』 ７ 御願事の数 〔 御光話（S24年 4月23日） 『御光話録』7号、昭和24(1949)年**月**日発行〕 ――神様にお願いいたしたいことがたくさんございますが、毎日いくつものお願い事をしても失礼には当たらないでしょうか。 『いくらでもかまいませんよ。いくらお願いしたって失礼にはなりません。第一、失礼だと思うことが失礼ですよ。神様は百でも千でもちゃんとお聞き分けになるんです。数は問題じゃありませんよ。もし数が多くて差し支えるんだったら浅草の観音様なんて骨が折れてかないませんよ。毎日何千て信者がお詣りするんですからね。』 ８ 地上天国の御歌を御神前で奉唱してもよい事 〔 御垂示（S28年6月1日） 『御垂示録』21号、昭和28(1953)年6月15日発行〕 「『地上天国』にいただきました御歌を御神前で奉唱することはいかがでございましょうか」 『結構です。やっぱり御讃歌と同じです。』 「御讃歌と同じように朝晩にお奏げすることもよろしゅうございますか」 『よいです。その場合に選択してよいです。こういうことは非常に皆のためによいということを選んで任意にやって構いません。』 「研究会などをいたします際に、その前後に御讃歌を奉唱し『信仰雑話』を拝読させていただくということはいかがでございましょうか」 『よいです。それからまた御讃歌の意味を「こういうように思う、こういう教えだと思う」ということを話してもよいです。それがよい働きをすればそれでよいのです。場合によっては、そのときの問題で疑問があるというときに、「御讃歌にこう出ている、これが多分その意味だろう」ということを言うのは非常に結構です。』 ９ 祈念の例 イ 職業の選択 〔 御光話（S24年4月特輯号） 『御光話録』6号、昭和24(1949)年4月23日発行〕 ――私は木工業と農業とを兼ねてやっておりますが、木工業に成功する見込みがありますでしょうか。（爆笑） 『これはね、信仰に入ってよくお願いすればね、どちらかいいほうに決めてくださいますよ。いったい迷っているときには、焦らずにお任せしていると、ある時期が来れば、どうしてもそうしなくてはならないようなことになってきますからね、そういうふうにすればいいんです。』 ロ 職業の選択 〔 教えの光（地上天国41号) 、昭和27(1952)年10月25日発行〕 「私は昭和二十六年六月入信、大光明如来様、御屏風観音様、大黒様を奉斎させていただき、昭和二十三年十二月より現住所にて砕石採取業を開設、本県各土木事務所を需要先として納入いたし、作業人員一日平均二十人くらい使役して生産搬出に努めておりますが、昨二十六年三月ごろ砕石工場の山の地滑りの天災をこうむり、砕石工場機械設備いっさい大破損を生じ、幸い人畜には被害なく、その後ようやく復旧いたし、今日まで生産を継続しておりまして、尊き御神業の御奉仕の万分の一端なりと努めさしていただき、当甘木支部、金子先生のもとにて御浄霊御指導いただいておりますが、私の経営の事業面が意のごとく進捗せず、貨物自動車事故および設備の電動機クラッシャー、エアーコンプレッサーなど交わる交わる故障など多く、なおまた税務署関係などは、こんな田舎に工場などの設備ない関係か、利潤の見込みを多額に要求され、まったく工場閉鎖の一歩前の現状でございますが、これもやはり私に課せられた罪穢の御浄化とでも申すものでございましょうか。もしや不相応で他に事業転換の時期のお知らせではございませんでしょうか。特別の御慈悲をもちまして明主様の御垂示御救い方賜りたく、謹んでお願いいたすしだいでございます。 次に私は昭和三年より昭和十五年まで、満十二年間県土木部勤務退職後福岡市に工務所を開設なし、一般土木工事測量設計業をなし、その後二カ年間春日原占領軍司令官ＣＲダグラス中佐のもと、ニックネーム「スピード」設計顧問として採用され、同中佐在日間仕えさしてもらい、引退の上現在の事業に着手今日に及んでおります。 以上参考まで申し述べさしていただきます。」 『現在の砕石業は、あなたには適していないから、転業したほうがいい。そうして大光明如来様によくお願いするとあなたの心に次の業が浮かぶから、その通りやればうまくゆく。』 ハ 井戸水が出ぬ場合 〔 御光話（S24年4月特輯号） 『御光話録』6号、昭和24(1949)年4月23日発行〕 ――私の村は井戸の少ない所で、現在では水の出なくなった井戸がたくさんございます。この井戸の所有者は稲荷の信者ですが、このたびその娘が入信いたしました。御浄霊により井戸水は出るようになりましょうか。また水が出ますように、光明如来様にお願いしてもよろしいでしょうか。 『ええ、なんにしろ、みんなが仕合せになることならなんでもお願いしていいですよ。このお願いの仕方といっても、思うことを言ってお願いすればいいんで、なにも特別にやり方があるわけではありませんよ。……これは水が出るようになります。信者が多くなれば水が出るようになるわけです。水を使うのは人間だから、いい人間が多くなればお恵みをくださるんです。どうしても悪い人間の多いときは思うようには行きません。』 10 一週に一度しか帰宅出来ぬ人の御神前について 〔 御垂示（S26年9月8日） 『御垂示録』2号、昭和26(1951)年10月10日発行〕 「大光明如来様をお祀りしている家ですが、弟が亡くなり、お婆さん一人なので看護に行っているうちに、そこの商売をするようになり、一週間に一回しか家に帰りませんので、大光明如来様に恐れ多いので、どうしたらというのでございますが――」 『現在ですがね。問題は――行ったり来たりですか。』 「一週間に一回帰って来ます」 『留守番は。』 「だれもおりません」 『しかたがないです。だってできないんだからね。神様はそんなことはない。つまりそういう場合に――できる場合はやらないと、人間のほうが疎（おろそ）かになるが、できないのはしかたがない。ですから、こういうわけで毎日はできないから、お許しを願いたいということを言って――そうすれば良いです。』 11 旅行先で相当期間家を留守にする場合の心得 〔 御光話（S24年 5月13日） 『御光話録』10号、昭和24(1949)年7月10日発行〕 ――光明如来様と御屏風観音様を家にお祀りしてあって旅行などで長く家を空ける場合、家族が信仰しておりませんと礼拝はおろか掃除もいたしませんが、こんなときには御軸をお巻きして、しまっておいたほうがよろしいでしょうか。また仏壇の位牌を旅行先に持って行って拝んでもよろしいでしょうか。 『そんなことをしなくてもいいですよ、掛けたままでいいんです。留守の者に信仰がなくてやらないんだから、これはやむを得ませんよ。この人が旅行先で祝詞なり御讃歌なりあげればそれでいいですよ。また位牌を持って行くなんてのもいけません。そのままにしておいて家のほうへ向かって遠くから……これが遥拝ですね、遥拝をすればいいんです。向こうは霊ですから、どんなに遠くともやって来ますよ。』 補 拍手の打ち方について 〔 御光話（S24年 6月 3日） 『御光話録』12号、昭和24(1949)年9月21日発行〕 『それから拍手を打ってもいいけど、もっと静かに打ちなさい、あるかないかくらいにね。あの強く叩くのは騒々しくていけない。信仰の深い人は静かに拍手を打つし、信仰の薄い人は強くやるっていう……妙なもんですが、こういう傾向がありますね。大勢で拍手を打つと大きな音になりますからね。やはり、近所が桐密な所なんかでは近所の人の耳障りになりますからね、軽くそっと打つようにしなくちゃいけない。そうするんなら打っていいですよ。』

――― 関 連 出 版 物 ――― 光は大地に 麻生 鋭 3 新 生 （一） 私の幼な友達で南チエという女が、沼津に住んでいる。実業家の主人を亡くしてからは、多少の家作も残っているので、近所の娘たちに手芸を教えてひっそりと暮している。 そのチエが、二カ月ほど前に手紙をよこして、 「いろいろ御相談したいことがあります。お暇を見て、一度いらして下さい」といって来た。しかし、それからそれへと忙しい日が続いて、出かける機会もなく今日になった。 今日は幸い日曜だし、晴れて風もなく、ぶらりと出かけるにはもって来いの散策日和である。チエの相談事というのを聞いたあと、時間があったら狩野川堤の桜でも見て来ようと思いながら、私は洋服に着替えた。 家を出る時、郵便箱をのぞいてみると、二、三の葉書といっしょに十円切手を三枚も貼った重い封筒が入っていた。その封筒には差出人の住所も名前も書いてない。消印は、茨城県の古河という局になっている。 “古河などという町に、知った人などないのだが……”と私は首をかしげた。 しかし、列車の時間が迫っているので、私はその場でざっと葉書にだけ目を通すと、その気味の悪い封筒をポケットに入れて、静岡駅へいそいだ。 天気がいいので、ホームは一ぱいの人だった。私はポケットの中の封筒に手を触れてみて、早く開いてみたいものだと思っていた。 まもなく列車が来た。 やっと一つあいている座席を見つけて、そこへ腰を下すと、私は早速、封筒の封を切った。 細かい字でギッシリ詰った便箋が、十幾枚も出て来た。念のために一番最後の便箋を見てみたが、そこにも名前は書いてなかった。 だが、改めて最初の数行を読んだ時、私は思わず声に出して「なあんだ。ミス・ローズか」と言ってしまった。混んでいる列車の中だけに、少し気まりが悪かった。 そこには、こんなことが書いてあった。 「私は先月五日、明主様の御面会日に、メシヤ教の仮本部の大広間で、あなた様のお隣に坐っておりました田舎娘でございます。その節、御名刺を頂きながら、私の方は名前も申し上げませんでした失礼を御ゆるし下さい。でも、あなた様は笑って、ミス・ローズにして置きますよとおっしゃいました。そのローズでございます。 今日、突然御手紙を差し上げますのは、あの節あなた様が御浄霊について私におたずねになり、私も何やかやと知ったかぶりを申し上げましたが、この私という不思議な女の身の上を、あなた様に聞いて頂こうと思い立ったからでございます。ただの一度、それも僅か十分間ほどお話しただけのあなた様に対して、こういう一方的な御手紙を差し上げるのは、まことに無礼とは存じますが、どうぞ作者の署名のない小説でも読むと思召して御読み捨て願いたいのでございます。それは確かに小説のような身の上なのでございますから」 （二） 窓の外を見ると、重なり合った山々も緑に霞んで、あちこちに浮いている雲の色も、もうすっかり春であった。列車は今、草薙駅の近くを走っている。 私は、手紙を読み続けた。 「私のように残酷な運命をもたせられてこの世に出て来た者が、広い世の中にもそう沢山あるとは考えられません。 私は前世で、一体どんな罪業を重ねたのでしょうか。私の生まれる夜、天上の星々は、きっと憎しみの眼のように、らんらんと青く燃えていたにちがいありません。その中でも特に私の宿命の星は、私という女を一生涯いじめつけようとして、この私を世の中へ送り出したのでしょう。そうでなければ、このような運命の下に生まれて来る人間などあるものではございません。 私は自分を呪って生きて来ました。自分を罪業の子と思って自棄的に生きて来ました。 けれども今は、もうそういう反抗的な気持はありません。ただ、二年前までの私が、凶悪な運命の中で必死にもがき、泣き、いっそ殺して下さいと何かに哀願しつづけて生きて来た女だったということを、それだけを最初に申し上げて置きます」 “残酷な運命と言うが、一体どんな不幸を背負って生まれて来たというのだろうか”と、私は胸に白バラを飾ったあの日の娘の面影を思い浮かべながら、再び読み続けた。 「実ほ私は、刑務所の産室で、この世の最初の光を浴びた赤児だったのでございます。 これだけでは、あなた様にはなんのことやらおわかりになりますまいから、順序を立ててお話することにいたします。 私の母ほど哀れな女性はなかったと思います。毎晩のように酒乱の良人――私の父にぶたれて、全身に生キズの絶えたことがなかったそうです。 それでも母は、じっと我慢していました。一度片付いて来た女はどんなことがあろうとも、二度と再び実家の敷居を跨いではならないものと堅く覚悟していた古い女性であったからです。 その父も、ただお酒を飲んで暴れているうちはまだよかったのですが、そのうちにどこからか、いかがわしい女を連れて来ました。そして、これ見よがしにその女に酌をさせ、酔えば母の髪をつかんで引ずり回すような乱暴をするのでした。女は笑ってそれを眺めていたそうです。 忍従の限界が切れました。おとなしい母も、とうとう復讐の鬼となりました。母はもう、昨日までの母ではなくなったのです。 その夜、母は、酔って眠っている父の上に馬乗りになり、出刃庖丁でのどを一突きにして殺し、続いてその側に寝ていた仇し女の顔を滅多ぎりにしてしまったのでした。その女は、間もなく運ばれた病院で死にました」 “なるほどこれはたまらない悲劇だ。その時、ミス・ローズは母の胎内に眠っていたというのか” 私は暗憺たる気持になった。 （三） 手紙は、まだ続いている。列車は、由比の海岸線に沿って走っている。人間のみじめさとは無関係に、海は静かに光っていた。 「警察の人が来た時、母は、動かなくなった父の体と、ザクロのように割れた血まみれの女の側に坐って、茫然としていたそうです。そして、警察に連れて行かれてからは、狂人のように暴れて、刑事部屋の畳の上を転がりながら、誰が誰を殺したというんだ、殺されたのは私じゃないか、私こそ殺されたんだ、と全身で怒っていたと言います。 ああ、けれどもその時、私という人間のいのちの微光が、既にこの母の胎内に宿っていたことを、母自身少しも知らなかったのです。言い変えるならば、私は、母が父を殺した晩にも、母の暗い胎内で、世にも恐ろしいその復讐を見ていたのです。こういう言い方はいけないでしょうか。でも、そう思って自分自身をいじめつけるよりほかに、どんな生き方があったでしょうか。 裁判の結果、母は情状を酌量されて、十二年の刑を言い渡されました。 それから九カ月、私は囚人服を着た母のおなかの中で育ち、月満ちて刑務所の中の産室で生まれました。 キリストは馬小屋の藁の上でお生まれになったそうですが、それはまあなんと柔らかく温かい産室でしたでしょう。野原のあちこちでは優しい羊たちが、メーメーと啼いて、イスラエルの救世主の誕生を祝っていたことでしょう。 それにくらべて、私の産室は、高い石の塀にかこまれた見るもいまわしい刑務所で、冷たいベッドのある部屋だったのです。一体誰がこの赤児を祝ってくれたでしょうか。 母は、私を産むと間もなく、ひどい高熱に犯されて、苦しみ悶えながら死にました。私を生んだ鉄のベッドが、そのまま母の死のベッドとなったのです。 母の死後、私の小さい体は、石の門を出て、茨城の伯母の手へと渡されました。私が今この手紙を書いております隣の部屋に、その伯母が針仕事をしているのでございます。ささやかな雑貨商を営みながら、今日まで女手一つで私を育てて下さった大恩人です。 私は、この伯母を母と呼んで、十八の年まで成長しました。その年まで、私は私の過去を何も知りませんでした。花のように笑い、鳥のように歌って、楽しい高校生活を終えました。 けれども私は、その春、卒業証書を頂いて帰って来た日に、これまで真実の母とばかり思っていた伯母から、実の母の秘密を知らされたのでした。 いつまでも隠しておくことは出来ないから……と、伯母は涙をこぼして、母（自分の妹）の地獄のような生涯を話してくれました。 ああ、それを聞いた時の私の驚き――それは到底、筆にも口にも表わせません。 私は天を呪い、地を呪いました。何故にこの世へ生まれ出て来たのだろうと、ハンカチをビリビリ破りながら泣きました」 （四） 「私は天を呪い、地を呪い、おのれを呪いました。自殺してしまおうとも思いました。もしもあの時、私の手に爆弾のようなものがあったなら、私はそれを持って母の墓地へ行き、その前で轟然と砕け散っただろうと思います。人間という人間に、私は木っ葉微塵となるぞ、見ていろと、怒鳴りつけて死にたい、こっそりとカミソリで頸動脈を斬るなんていう死に方では嫌やだと考えていたからです。日も夜も私は、何者かへの復讐を考えていました。 けれども、私は自殺する必要がなくなったのです。それは、その年の秋、私は突然血を吐いたからです。 私は肺結核を宣告されました。びっくりした伯母は、医者よ薬よと、私のために惜しみなくお金を使って下さいました。それでも私は、決して治りたいとは考えませんでした。伯母の温かい看病には涙ぐみつつも、このまま死んで行けば世話がなくていいと、そればかりを願っていました。 こんな病人てあるものでしょうか。私の肺からゴボゴボと血が出るたびに、私は、もう死ねる、もう死ねると思って、苦しさとは逆の楽しい気持になったものでございました。 ある日、医者が母の耳に、あと二カ月しかもたないだろうとささやいているのを聞いた時も、私は驚きませんでした。却って、その二カ月を待ち望むような気持でした。 ああ、二カ月。早く可哀そうなお母さんの所へ行きたい。 でも、そういう気持の時に御浄霊を受けたことは、ただ単に伯母が可哀そうだったからだということは、先日お目にかかった時にも申し上げました。御浄霊を受けながら、私は胸の中で軽蔑していました。こんなことで私の肺が元通りになるならやってみなさい、私は本当は早く死にたいのですよと、反抗していました。 ところが、あんなに重かった私の肺結核が治ったのです。肺は再び生き生きと活動し出し、半年後には以前よりも丈夫なからだになったのでございます」 私は、ここまで一気に読んで来て、思わずフーッと溜息をついた。ああいう可愛いらしい娘を死なさなかった造物主への感謝のこころと、それにしても自棄と反抗の中で暴れていた娘がどうしてこんな素直な娘に変ったのだろうかという疑問のこころとが、私の頭の中で旋回していた。 列車は、富士駅を出たばかりである。ここから身延線へ乗り換えて富士宮へ行けば、去年私にメシヤ教の手引書をくれた老婦人がいるのだなと思い、縁というものの不思議さを感じた。 私は、また手紙に目をやった。 「その後、私は不思議な事実にぶつかりました。あり得ないことが、あり得るということを、この眼で見たのでございます。そんなことは絶対にないと、よく人は言います。しかし、私は、この不思議な事実にぶつかってからは、絶対などという言葉を、相対の身の人間が使ってはならない、ということを知りました」 （五） 「ある日のこと、伯母と私は、町の大通りを歩いていました。買物の帰りでした。 突然曲り角からオートバイが飛び出て来たと思うと、私のすぐ前で、バリバリと大きな音を立てて横倒しに倒れたのです。私は反射的に、バネ仕掛のように飛びのきました。危ないところでした。 でも、次の瞬間、私はそのオートバイの車輪の下に、子供が轢かれているのを見ました。 オートバイを運転していた男の人は、ようやく起き上ると、倒れた車の下からその子供を引き出しました。子供はぐったりとしていました。運転していた男の人は、子供を抱きかかえて、医者、医者と言っていました。青ざめた顔の、その額から血が垂れていました。 しかし、その時には、道を歩いていた人がもう何人も集って来ていました。店の中から飛び出て来る店員もいました。 「医者は、すぐそこだ。一緒に行ってやろう」と、その中の一人が言いました。子供は生きているのか死んだのか、だらりと腕を垂らして抱かれたままです。 ところが、オートバイを運転していた男の人が、医者の家の方へ駈け出そうとした時でした。ウーンとうなって、子供は眼を開いたのです。 それは重くパッチリとした静かな眼でした。苦痛の影などどこにもない眼で、自分を抱いている見知らぬ人を見ました。 ここまでお話すれば、あなた様にも想像がおつきになるだろうと思いますが、私が不思議な事実と申し上げましたのは、その子供が無事だったということなのです。 考えても御覧下さいませ。あれだけの速力で走って来たオートバイにひっかけられながら、あとでお医者が調べてもカスリ傷一つ発見出来なかったなどということがあるものでしょうか。驚いて駈けつけた母親に手を引かれて、その子供は元気でお医者の家から戻って来たと、町の人たちは言っております。 そして、そのお医者も、あんなことは千に一つもないと考え込んでいたそうですが、あなた様はどうお思いになりますか。不思議だとはお考えになりませんか。 家へ帰って来てからも、私はいろいろのことを考えました。もしあのオートバイがこちら側に倒れたら、私も子供と一緒に車輪の下に入っていたかも知れない、そして、脚の一つぐらいは砕かれていたかも知れない。最悪の場合には、頭骸骨を割られて死んでいたかも知れない――そんなことも考えました。この私の命拾いを、ただ偶然という二字で片づけてしまっていいものかどうか――それも考えました。 又、これとは別に、あの子供がなんの傷も負わなかったことを思い、あの子供の命を救った者はなんだろうとも考えました。 千に一つもないことが、この世にはいくらでもあり得る、万に一つもないことが、常に起っている――しかし、それがなんであるかは、言葉でぼ説明出来ません。私は、物理学すら越えるものが、この世界にはあると申したいのでございます」 （六） 「けれど、本当のことを申しますと、私が拙いペンをとってあなた様に特に聞いて頂きたいことは、病気が治ったとか、オートバイに轢かれてむカスリ傷一つ負わなかったというようなお話ではないのでございます。もっともっと素晴しい奇蹟のことなのです。 それは、メシヤ教に入れて頂いてから、私のあれほどの煩悶がきれいに拭い去られてしまったということです。なあんだ、そんなことかなどとおっしゃいますな。現在の私は、二年前の私ではありません。新生という言葉が一番ぴったりするのですが、全く新しく生まれ変った別の女になったのです。 人間は新しく生まれなけれは、神の国に入ることは出来ないと言ったのはキリストではなかったでしょうか。私は新しく生まれて、このからだ全体で、今こそ神のふところの中にすっぽりと包まれているという幸福を感じております。 只今の私には、ただ有難いという気持があるだけでございます。刑務所で、良人殺しの母の胎内から生まれて来たというような極悪運命、も、それも何かの力だと知りました。その力によって、私は生まれ、育ち、病み、全快し、救われて、現在こうして明るい光の中で暮らしていかれるのだと思えば、何事もつぶやくことはいりません。 人間が新しく生まれ変るということ――人生にこれほど大きな奇蹟がありましょうか。誰がこういう水際立ったことをやってのけるのでしょうか。人間の手で人間を新生させるなどということが出来るものではございません。その誰かは、神というものでなくてなんでしょうか。私は今は、神のまにまにということの意味が十分にわかったと申し上げたいのです。生意気な小娘だなどと叱らないで下さいませ。 あなた様がどういう境涯を経て来られた方かは存じませんが、もしも何か苦しいことや悲しいことがありました時は、この私という無学な田舎娘の言葉を思い出して頂きたいと存じます。メシヤ教で言う主神――主にして最高なる唯一の神の不思議な力を思い出して下さいませ」 ミス・ローズの長い手紙はこれで終っていた。私は世にも哀れな出生物語もあるものかなと思い、瞼の裏が熱くなって来るのであった。そして、人間を新しく生まれ変らせるメシヤ教の力というものはなんだろうかと考えてみた。 一人の人間が、黒から白になる、昨日の悲しみが、今日は幸いに変る。一本の髪の毛も白くしたり黒くしたりすることの出来ない人間が、何か絶妙な力を出す者の働きなくして、どうして、昨日と今日と全く別の人間になることが出来るだろうか。 初めて会っただけの娘が、こういう告白の手紙をくれたという不思議な縁を思いながら、その手紙が、野越え山越え、無数の人間の中を通って、私という特定の人間の手に届いたということも、不思議と言えは不思議だと思った。 （七） 列車は沼津駅へ着いた。 私は駅前から千本浜行のバスに乗った。 何かあるのだろう、町の空にポーンポーンと花火が上っていた。 公園の入口で降りて、松林の中を通り抜けて行くと、そこにチエの家がある。「風の吹く日は海がごうごうと鳴って、眠れないくらいだ」といつか彼女は書いて来たが、すぐ眼の下は海で、生垣の前の砂地を、赤いカニがひそひそと這っている。 チエは家にいた。日の当る縁側で、猫と遊んでいた。今日は手芸の稽古の方も休みなのであろう。 「やっと出て来た」と言うと、 チエは笑って、 「お花見が目的で、私の方はついでなのでしょう」と言った。 「まあ、そうだね」と、私も笑って答えた。 しばらく世間話をしたあと、 「ところで、人生問題で悩んでるというのは、どういうことなんだね」と、私はきいた。 「それがね、笑っちゃいけませんよ。再婚問題なの」 「笑うもんですか。おめでとうと言いたいところだ」 「言いたいところというのは、変な御挨拶ですね」 「だって、おめでたいなら、何も相談することはない筈じゃありませんか」 「ご名答よ」と、チエは寂しそうに笑って言った。そして、そのまま何か考えている。 「狩野川堤の桜見物の方はあきらめてもいいから、その悩みというのを話してごらん」と、私は促した。 すると、チエは真面目な顔で、 「私、この年まで恋愛というものをしたことがないけれど、ときどき胸のところがキューッと痛くなるのが恋愛なの？」ときくのであった。 「そうだね。少くともウキウキなんてのは、本物の恋愛じゃないだろうな」と、私も真面目に答えた。 「その方は、五年前に奥さんを亡くして、それからずっと独りで一粒種のお嬢さんを育てていらしたのですが、そのお嬢さんも昨年お片付きになって……それでまあ再婚しようとお思いになったのだそうです。そして、私をというお話なのです。そのお嬢さんが手芸を習いに来ていらしたので、私はその方をよく存じています。大学で英文学を教えていらっしゃるの。とても温厚な紳士で……」 「それなら何も悩むことはないでしょう。名実共におめでとうですよ。早いところ結婚にゴールインすることだ」と、私はからかうように言った。 チエは黙っていた。私は気合が抜けたような気持で煙草に火をつけた。 しばらくして、チエは、 「実は、ときどき私の胸のところをキューッと締めつける人というのは、その方ではないのです。その方とくらべたら、問題にならないくらい知性の低い男なのよ。でも、私にはどうしても、その人が忘れられないのです。これはどうしたことでしょうか」と言った。 （八） 私は暗然とした。どうしてこう人間というものはややこしく出来ているのだろうと思った。 結婚してくれという人は、優しく頼もしい人だが、だから尊敬はしているが、燃えるような愛情が燃えて来ない。 もう一人の男は、知性も低く、人間的尊敬はもてないが、切なくも夜ごとの夢に出て来るという。チエの言うように、一体これはどうしたことか。 「わからないな」と、私は首をかしげて言った。 「わからないのが当り前よ。自分にだってわからないのですものね」と、チエが笑った。 「いや、そうじゃない。私がわからないというのは、あなたの気持がわからないというのではなくて、女が男にひかれる気持の中に仲よく同居している反対のもののことなんだ。例えば、愛と憎しみとか、尊敬と軽蔑とか、心と体とか……」 「むつかしい理屈はどうでもいいわ。今の私は、その大学の先生と再婚した方がいいのかどうかということを教えて欲しいの」 「だから、わからないと言ってるんだよ。私にだって、どうとも言えない。新聞や婦人雑誌の身上相談なら、間違いなく大学の先生との結婚を勧めるだろうがね」 「でも、折角来て頂いて、わからないでは心細いわ。なんとか言って下さらなければ……」 「だから、言っているじゃないか。常識で言うことは易しいが、人生には常識だけでは解決しないことが多いからね。再婚したければ、再婚すればいい――そう言うより仕方ない。薄情のようだがこういう返事が実は一番親切なんだ」 「では、もしこれがあなた自身の問題だったら？」 「それもわからない。しかし、こういうことは言えると思うな。人間の理性なんて本当に頼りないものだということだ。あなただってそうだ。簡単と言えば極めて簡単なことなのだが、いざとなると混乱して来て、判断がつかない。それなのに、理性、理性という人の気が知れない」 「だって、理性にきかなければ一体何にきくの？」と、チエが遮るように言った。 「そりゃ、理性は尊敬されなければならないだろうさ。だが、その理性の裏づけとして、信仰というものがないと、理性が理性として通用しなくなる時がある。人事を尽くして天命を待つとか、神に聞くとかいうのは、そういう危なっかしい理性以上のものを信じて生きろという教訓なんだ」 そう言いながら、私はふと妙な気がした。今日はなんて変な日なのだろうと思った。朝、家を出る時に、ミス・ローズの数奇な運命を綴った封筒を受け取ったが、今はここでチエから人間心理の混沌さを聞かされている。こういう人間を二十億以上も集めて、泣いたり笑ったりさせている地球という泥の塊りが、滑稽に思えて仕方なかった。 「もっとよく考えてみますわ」と、チエが小さな声で言った。 （九） 「そうだ。もっとよく自分で考えてみることだね」 そう言って私は立ち上った。 チエも、そこまで送って行くと言って、下駄をはいた。 松林の中の、木漏れ日の砂地を歩きながら、私は、 「隣れみは恋愛に似ている、という諺がイギリスにあるが、尊敬もまた恋愛に似ているものだ。尊敬する気持のない恋愛もこまるが、しかし尊敬はどこまでも尊敬で、尊敬即ち恋愛じゃない。ここのところをよく考えてみるんだね」と言った。 「恋愛は理性の世界よりも、むしろ本能の世界のものだということがわかって来ました」と、チエがつぶやくように答えた。 「そうかも知れないけれど、しかし、その本能というやつは危険極まりない猛獣だからね。だからその猛獣を、理性の鞭で調教して行かなければならないわけだが、しかしその理性なるものが、アテになるようでアテにならない。そこでやっぱり信という一字が大切になって来るんだ。信は理性以前のものではなくて、その理性を理性として微動だもさせない支柱みたいなものさ。鉢作りの大輪の菊は自分の茎で立っているんじゃない。支柱で真直ぐに立っているんだ。だから、信のない理性などというものは、風の吹くたびにヒラヒラしている枝の先の枯葉みたいなものだよ。あぶなくて見ていられない」 「私もこんどの問題で、どうしていいかわからなくなって、それであなたの知恵を借りたくなったのよ」と、チエが心細そうに言った。 「ところが、その知恵たるや、私たちのは凡夫の知恵だ。猿の知恵とそう違いはない。あやふやなものさ」と、私は素直に答えた。 私達は公園の入口のところまで歩いて来て、そこからバスに乗った。後部のガラス窓から見ていると、チエは自分の家とは反対の方へ歩き出していた。自分で自分の考えを整理しようというのだろう。 “苦しむことは、いいことだ” 私はチエの姿が海浜ホテルの塀に隠れてしまうまで、そんなことを思っていた。 御成橋でバスを降りた。 向う岸の草の上には、あちこちに若い男女が坐って、土手の上の桜を見ているようでもあり、桜などどうでもいいようでもあった。桜はまだ八分咲きであった。 私はゆっくりとその橋を渡りながら、何か罪を犯したような気持になっていた。信の世界などと大きなことを言ったが、一体チエに何を信じろと言うのだろうか。イワシの頭も信心からというが、まさかイワシの頭もやれないではないか。私の忠告が間違っているとは思わないが、それにしても親切とは言い兼ねる。 私はむしろチエに、こう言うべきではなかったろうか――「その頼りにならない男はあきらめなさい。そして大学教授と結婚しなさい。これは常識だよ。でも、常識こそ宗教だということに気がつくまでに、私は三十年の歳月を無駄にした。信とは、いうならば常識に安住する心だよ」 （十） 橋を渡りながら、私はふと香貫山のかげにある春秋寺を思い出した。その山門の横に見事な桜の老木のあるのを知っていたからかも知れない。 その寺には、玄海という面白い禅坊主がいる。私とは小学校時代からの友達である。よし、玄海を訪ねてやろう。 山門の横の桜も、まだようやく八分咲きであった。 私は本堂の裏の土間へ入って行って、 「今日は」と声をかけた。 「よう、珍しいな」と、玄海が出て来た。 書斎兼寝室みたいな部屋に上ると、坐る間もなく玄海が、 「いそがしいんだろう。俗人は気の毒なものだ」と言った。 「ところが悠々閑日月を楽しんでいるんだ」と、私も負けずに言った。 「負け惜しみを言うな。目に落ちつきがないぞ」 「はははは。白状すれば、本当は少し忙しい。だから、無事是れ貴人の心境には程遠い」 「貴人というより非人という相だな」と、玄海は面白そうに笑った。 「だが、この貴人というのは、どういう人間のことを言うのか、君は知っているのか」と、私も刀を大上段に振りかぶって見せた。 「これは驚いた。専門家に逆に質問しやがる」 「そもそも貴人とは、カブと同じものだ」 「カブ？」 「そうさ。野菜のカブだよ」 「それはまたどういうわけだ」 「さては、君は太閤記を読んだことがないな」 「ないよ」 「その太閤記の中に、こういうくだりがある。ある日、明智光秀の所へ一人の画家がやって来た。光秀の顔をつくづく眺めでいたが、やがて色紙を取り出して、カブの画を描いた。そして、それに、無事是れ貴人という賛を書いた」 「だから、カブが貴人なのか」 「そうさ。カンの鈍い禅坊主だな。カブは金儲けのことなんぞ考えやしないよ」 「いや、僕が鈍いのはいいが、光秀にもわからなかったんだろう」 「そうだよ。だから、それから間もなく本能寺に夜討をかけて、信長を殺した。無事のよさを悟らなかったんだな」 そんなことを話し合っているうちに、私はメシヤ教についての考えを聞いてみようと思い立った。そこで、 「僕はこのごろ、お光様の教義を研究してるんだよ」と言った。 「メシヤ教というやつか。よせよ、あんなもの。つまらない」 「どうして、つまらない？」 「だって、おまじないで病気を治して、それで儲けている宗教だろ？」 「では、君たち坊主は何をしているんだね。葬式ばかりアテにしているじゃないか。同じ庶民の金で食うつもりなら、葬式で食うよりも、病人を一人でも治して、そのお礼で食う方が上等だよ」 （十一） 「葬式坊主か。あんまりこの善良な男をいじめるなよ」 玄海はそう言って、真実情なさそうな表情をした。 「いや、僕もつい最近までは、メシヤ教なんて歯牙にもかけていなかったんだ。しかし、少しばかり文献を読んでいるうちに、こいつは今までの宗教と違って芸術でもあるということを知ったんだよ」 「と言うと、どういうことになるんだね」 「要するにだね。神を信じない者でも、実は信じているんだ。エホバは信じないでも、ミューズは信じるんだ。カトリックの聖母崇拝には、多分に芸術的感銘が加わっている。そして、それで結構だと思うよ。メシヤ教では、だから青白い顔して、来世々々なんて悲しいことばかりは言わないよ。まず自分が幸福になること――そう言っている。自分がこの世の不幸の見本みたいな顔をしていて、どうして他の者を幸福に出来るかというんだ」 「現世の幸福とは？」 「丈夫で働けて、三度々々のめしが食えて、そして隣り近所と仲よく出来れば、あとは何も言うことないじゃないか」 「全くだ。君に言われるまでもなく、われわれ坊主は、メシヤ教を悪く言う資格はない。なんにもしないで後生楽をきめこんでいるのだからな。せめて、あらゆる寺に図書室ぐらいこしらえて、近所の人にいい本を読ませたいさ」 「そのくらい反省していれば、まあ賞めてやってもいい。だが、如何なるか是れ仏、答う庭前の柏樹子……なんて寝言みたいなことを言っているだけが、今の禅坊主の生活じゃないか。あれでは知識人の趣味以上には出ないね。自分だけはいい気持かも知れないが、隣には貧乏で、病気で、自殺しようかなと考えている人間がいるんだよ」 「いよいよ辛辣だね。何が憎くて、そう毒舌を吐くんだい」 「憎らしくはないさ。だが、君たちのように鍛錬で――言い変えれば自力でおのれが救えると思うのは滑稽だ。そんなら、人間力で緑の花を製造してみろ」 「じゃ、他力はどうだ」 「少くとも素直でいい。しかし自力だ、他力だといっているうちはまだ駄目だ。芸術に――美というものに、自力と他力の本願の区別があるかね。美しいものは、説明なくして美しいよ」 「ちょっと、神道の言い方に似てるぞ」 「浄、明、正、直か。この四つを一緒にして、まことというんだってね。すっきりしていていいよ」 「すると、メシヤ教は神道か」 「そんな小うるさい塀はない。みんなの広場だ。第一、メシヤという言葉はキリスト教的だし、教祖の画いた観音像を御神体といってるところは神道的だし、その観音の慈悲にすがって仕合せになろうというところは仏教的じゃないか。要するに、芸術的なんだよ」 夜おそく、私は春秋寺の門を出た。玄海が、山門の桜の下で、 「又、来てくれ」と言った。 （十二） 帰りの列車は静かであった。 夜天の富士には余計なものがなく、削り取ったように、ただ黒々として美しかった。 私はふと、岡田茂吉の生い立ちを書いてみたらどんなものが出来るだろうかと考えた。 貧乏長屋に生まれた栄養不良の赤児が、乳を欲しがってピーピー泣いている。風が強く、二間しかない家の雨戸がガタガタ揺れている。嵐になりそうな空模様である。 「今夜は降るぞ。早く寝るとしよう」と、父親があきらめたように言う。 「あしたのお米を、今のうちに借りて来ます」と、母親が油気のない髪を指でかき上げながら言う。 日が暮れると、古道具類を荷車に積んで、十町ほど離れた往来へ夜店を出しに行くしがない渡世―― 岡田茂吉は、こういう環境に育った。病気ばかりしていて、いつもゴホンゴホンと咳をしているような、しかし眼だけは涼しく澄んだ子供であった…… “それは、なまじっかの作りものよりも、ずっと面白い物語になるだろう”と、私は思った。 “どんなものにも存在理由はある。メシヤ教も、突如として生まれ出て来たものではない。どんな花だって、茎や葉がなければ開かない。そして、茎の下には根がなければならない。とするならば、この宗教の一番下の方には、岡田という人間の根が張っていなければならない筈だ。イエスという大工の伜を抜きにして、キリスト教が成り立つだろうか。天理教の根は中山ミキだし、大本教の根は出口直子だ。そうだ、まず人間岡田茂吉を裸にしてみよう” そう思うと、反射的に私の現に浮かんで来たのは、いつか教祖が書いていた一つの文章である。 「……私は若い頃、哲学書を読むのが好きであった。そのうちでも、ジェームズのプラグマチズム（哲学行為主義）に最もひかれた。ジェームズに言わせれば、単に哲学の理論を鋭くだけでは遊戯以上に出ない、宜しく哲学を行為で現わすべきで、それでこそ価値があると言うのである。私はこれに共鳴して、その当時、哲学を私の仕事や日常生活の上にまで練り込むように努力した」とも書いてあった。 「私はその後、宗教を信ずるに当って、この哲学行為主義を宗教にまで及ぼさなくてはならないと考えた。即ち宗教行為主義である。どんな職業や境遇にある人でも、宗教を行為に現わすことによってその人の運命をよくし、社会に貢献することが出来る」とも書いてあった。 しかし、私の感心したのは次の数行であった。 「だが、いくら宗教を行為に現わすと言っても、ミソのミソ臭いように、臭くなるのはいけない。世間にはよく信仰を鼻の先へブラ下げているような人がある」 列車は富士の黒い影を車窓に映して、ごうごうと鉄橋を渡った。 私は、岡田という人間は、機関車のような人間だと思った。

「光は大地に」明主様の紹介コメント 『御教え集』31号、昭和29(1954)年3月15日発行 昭和二十九年二月十七日 ［中略］ 二、三日前に分かったことですが、『静岡民報』で三月一日から救世教のこと……というが、私のことですが、三カ月にわたって連載するというのです。これはこっちで頼んだわけでもないし、どういう考えか知りませんが、突然話があったのです。一昨日の新聞に予告がありましたが、なかなかおもしろく書いてありますから、読ませてみます。 （『静岡民報』二月十五日付「世界メシヤ教物語」） それで、最初の原稿を二十枚ばかり読んでみたのですが、なかなかおもしろく書いてあるのです。非常に興味津々たる……といったようなものです。その中でも、私が非常に愉快に思ったのは、面会の時に一度ここに来たのですが、その時に、「話が終わって、浄霊して、それからここから出るその格好は、ちょうど田舎のじいさんが汽車の時間が迫って急いで歩くような、そういう格好だ」と言うのです。なかなかおもしろく書いてありました。ただ、私は別に会ったこともないし、教団の人とそう詳しい話も聞いたようでもないのですが、三カ月も連載するというのですから、どういう材料で、どういうふうに書くか、非常に興味があると思うのです。それから、どういう考えでそういう企画を起こしたのか、それも分からないのです。だんだん分かるでしょうが、決して先に邪念がないということはよく分かります。マイナスよりプラスの方が多いということは認められます。そういうわけで、願わくば、もう少し、東京あたりの大新聞とまでゆかなくても、中新聞ぐらいのところに出たら、なお良いと思うのですが、けれども、とにかく地方新聞でも、そういうことによっていずれは東京の新聞なども、俺の方でも出してみようかとか、あるいは有力な雑誌とか、そういう方のジャーナリストを刺激する点もいくらかあると思います。なんにしても、チョット出すのではなく三カ月も連続的に出すのですから、いくらか小説的と言いますか、なにかおもしろいと思います。別にどうこうでなくて、非常に興味があると思います。また信者さんなども大いに楽しみだというようなこともあるでしょう。今の新聞に写真も出てますが、たいへんよく出ているということです。良い悪いは、自分のことだから分からないが、若くは写っているようです。
